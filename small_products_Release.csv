BROWN may not know (or believe) that he began his professional life as a Glasgow folky and gained first fame as a stand-up comic. Now's your chance to catch up on his sordid past with these compilations from his club recordings of the '70s and '80s. He loves the shaggy dog story and the wicked song but doesn't mind flinging one-liners either. His raucous, scatological, profane humor is best enjoyed by heavy drinkers familiar with the Scottish tongue. The rest of us will get plenty of yuks from those punch lines we can decipher.

Unfortunately, sometimes what is around us is war. Acclaimed British actor Paul McGann reads poems that date from the eighteenth century to modern times in this moving audio anthology. McGann is originally from Liverpool, and he still retains a slight Northern accent. Its lilting cadence blends well with the rhythm and worldliness of these powerful poems.

SIR ORFEO is a Celtic version of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, complete with a happy ending that the older story lacks. Terry Jones, former member of Monty Python and a medieval scholar to boot, sounds perfectly comfortable with the rhythms and language.

First she tackled the  unfortunate Scott expedition to the South Pole inThe Birthday Boys; later (but emphatically pre-DiCaprio) came the sinking of the Titanic, inEvery Man for Himself. Now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the Crimean War, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the Light Brigade's charge--but, thankfully, without the Tennysonian bombast. ""Some pictures,"" a character confides, ""would only cause alarm to ordinary folk."" There's a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:Master Georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.Bainbridge's narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of George Hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous Liverpool life by heading for the Crimean Peninsula in 1854. His journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: Myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her ""Master Georgie"" becomes an overriding obsession; Pompey Jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and George's sometime lover; and Dr. Potter, George's scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the war's carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.United by a sudden death in a Liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. In between, Bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses ""fractured into a spider's web""; a decapitated leg, toes ""poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot""; two dead men ""on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands."" Glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.Master Georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",16.95,"{'also_viewed': ['0349116156', '0307947726', '0786702079', '0786701463', '0786707739', 'B001IDZK0I', '0226743497', '0786703229', '0802142818', '0375700234', '0679731369', '0812976533', '0385722109', '1609450868', '1416562605', 'B000GH2YRY', '0679777504', '1590170180', 'B001LF2H7W', '0374526400', '0807608815', '1573225436', '1609450566', 'B003H4RCJS', '1586420046', '0143124870', '0571319661', '0385474547', '0140092552', '0316074314'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0349116156', '1609450868', '0307947726', 'B008SM8T5K']}",

Irina sees the old rocking horse in a junkstore window and decides she must have it. The proprietor, sensing her need for it, gives Bella to her, and tells her about a live Bella, a beautiful, once-wild horse that used to belong to a local farmer who mistreated her. As the wooden horse gradually comes to life, Irina blossoms. She is happier than she has ever been, especially when her Bella takes her on thrilling midnight rides. One cold winter night, the animal leaves the child to run through the hills with a herd of wild horses. Irina is devastated. Too late she realizes she has not heeded the storekeeper's warning ""Never say that any creature on this earth is yours...."" She withdraws into herself again-until Bella returns, bringing her injured foal for Irina to nurse. This time she promises herself to let it go when it is grown. In so doing, she frees herself to grow up. The message may seem obvious to some, but that will not deter young horse lovers and beginning readers of fantasy, who will be absorbed by the details of equistrian care, the magic of the animal's transformation, and the excitement of the late-night rides. The many fine black-and-white drawings convey Irina's sadness, Bella's magical changes, and the strong energy of the galloping horses.Virginia Golodetz, St. Michael's College, Winooski, VTCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",8.09,,

The book opens as the Little Princess screams, ""I want my dinner!"" The picture of her red-faced temper tantrum, complete with silverware flying through the air, shows more than the text reveals. Next, she demands her potty (while squeezing toothpaste all over the cat). Finally, she remembers to say the magic word when she requests her teddy bear. Then, on a walk, she encounters a big, red-nosed blue Beastie. He pitches a fit about wanting his dinner, and the Little Princess tells him to say please. The smiling, yellow-crowned child reminds him to say thank you, too. The simple text combined with exuberant, colorful watercolors show Ross at his best. Any child who has been reminded to be courteous will appreciate the cheerful, comical illustrations.?Janet M.

Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  - she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77.",6.15,,

He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, """"Prophetic Truth,"""" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.""--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",2.96,"{'also_bought': ['0001472933', '1614271046', '0310308909', '1169770673', '1603864830', 'B000GGTK2M', '160386489X', 'B000872ZB2', 'B000ALVEHM', '1169723578', '0963584529', '1614270074', 'B0094V8OXG', '0962880914', '1579106323', '0324222882', '0687413559', '0830825916', '084231251X', '0664240224', '083412257X'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['1614271046', '160386489X', '1596053003', '1603864830']}",

In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, Passover seder--that set them apart, but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen, co-editor of Christmas in America , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom, Leah Adler, who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant, combines the two themes). A picture of the Jewish attorneys of a Century City law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a Brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.",,"{'also_viewed': ['B001KKBALC', '0231108419']}",

He and his siblings are named after places, his twin sisters are always getting into trouble, and his parents are former hippies. But things take a turn for the worse in their small Vermont town when his parents inform him that his father is gay. A homophobic bullying incident outside a pharmacy, in which the store's owner attempts to protect Cisco with a shotgun, turns ugly and the next thing Cisco knows, he's responsible for putting Mr. Patterson in a coma. In an attempt to give their son a fresh start, the boy's parents send him to his Uncle Vincent's ranch in middle-of-nowhere British Columbia, but Cisco's fate doesn't immediately improve upon landing on Canadian soil. He appreciates cooking and eating good food, but his uncle's moose stew is barely edible. Belgue excels at capturing the realities of small-town life. Likewise, details of the Canadian wilderness will make readers feel transported to the great white North. Unfortunately, the story suffers from uneven pacing and characters who never quite come to life. While Cisco's cooking aspirations could draw an audience, they are not a large enough part of the story and fail to carry it. Given the dearth of YA fiction featuring gay parents, this title is significant. However, the Canadian setting and other shortcomings make it a hard sell.&#8212;Jennifer Barnes, Gleason Public Library, Carlisle, MA(c) Copyright 2011. &#xA0;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

The latest in the publisher's series of regional cookbooks (others on Italy, China and Asia have preceded it), it will keep readers turning pages even if they never pick up a saucepan. Chapters alternate between discussing the different regions of France and offering a good selection of traditional recipes. French-born authors and cooks Marianne Comolli, Elisabeth Scotto and Michele Carles reflect on the history and geography of France with appetizers from Provence, entrees from Lyonnais and desserts from Anjou. This is hearty, not haute , cuisine: well-organized recipes are scaled for the average cook, who won't have to go in search of rare ingredients or spend hours chopping and mincing.

The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

France's adaptation to unless France really developed it.aa the motor car changed Proust's way of life. A new subjectivism, spurred by Bergson's spiritual philosophy, made possible Debussy's exploration of musical nuance, Picasso and Braque's invention of Cubism, and poet Charles Peguy's vision of a socialist utopia. Mingling gossip, biography and astute commentary, this chronicle tracks Diaghilev, Colette, Mattise and a host of others. Cronin, biographer of Napoleon, argues persuasively that Parisians' chilly rancor toward Germans stemmed in part from France's sense of national pride.

McIntyre's bicentenary biography (his last was a life of BBC founder John Reith, The Expense of Glory) is unsparing about Burns and his uneven output, from haunting lyrics to bawdy songs. Carlyle, so McIntyre writes, saw Burns's career as ""a tragedy of potential unfulfilled and opportunity squandered."" Rather, McIntyre contends, there was scant opportunity in hardscrabble Ayrshire in Burns's time, and the flavor of that bleak life as it was actually lived is vividly evoked, as are the poet's self-defeating imprudences of every sort. Having little schooling, Burns pragmatically described his working methods as ""Untill I am compleat master of a tune, in my own singing... I can never compose for it."" His practice was not that of the university, but it produced ""Flow gently, sweet Afton"" and ""The Cotter's Saturday Night."" He also produced more children, illegitimate and legal, than he could afford, and left his plough for a meager salary as excise tax inspector that kept him on horseback and away from home, from the contemplative time for writing and from exploiting usefully his flair for friendship with admiring men and adoring women in circles above his class. His lyrical gift had pushed him out of the milieu that moved him to verse. As McIntyre observes, Burns's local literary reputation, once spread, ""had both made and undone him."" He had ""an extraordinary blindness to where his own interest lay."" Although he was ""never the slave of time,"" that became another of his many failings. McIntyre's careful scrutiny of Burns is exemplified by his quoting an exculpatory letter ostensibly done in haste. ""Pardon this confused scrawl,"" Burns explains. ""?Indeed I know not well what I have written."" But, McIntyre notes, ""That was not strictly true?he had taken time to try his hand at a draft.""

He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images. Both recommended for their candid presentation of ordinary daily life.

The late author, a correspondent at the trials, used his experience, memoirs, transcripts, and interviews to construct a personal and insightful account of this important event. Richard Minear's Victor's Justice (1971) is a more analytic treatment, but The Other Nuremberg will appeal to layperson and scholar alike. Recommended. Kenneth W. Berger, Duke Univ.

He was especially disturbed when his spy masters began treating him with contempt; he defected to the West in 1980. A 30-year veteran of the KGB, Dzhirkvelov's descriptions of organizational structures at various levels along with operational techniquesincluding activities he took part inrepresent a rare insider's look at the Soviet security system. On the other hand, this defector claims that the 1953 ""doctor's plot"" against Stalin was nothing more than ""an amusing idea"" of the Western media, that the KGB is not as powerful as is generally thought in the West, and that stories of religious persecution in the Soviet Union are greatly exaggerated.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,,

Celebrating the land and its citizens, these 200 mainly color photographs are accompanied by maps indicating the location of each and by concise captions. Subjects include a Benedictine nun on a monastery farm, a man soaking in his bath at a spa, a covey of ""punk rockers"" in a Dublin neighborhood, the bishop of Cork putting ""a little body Irish"" on a road bowling match.

Many had participated in A Day in the Life of Canada ( LJ 11/1/85) and the similar books on Australia and Hawaii. This, however, is the first such coverage of a non-Western, non-English-speaking country. The color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. The pictures are arranged chronologically, from early morning until late at night. A map of Japan shows where each was taken.

The lessons Harvey Penick taught in the pre-gadget days  still stand. The golf swing is basically the same, and Penick could teach it better than anybody. For most of his life, he never intended to publish hisLittle Red Book, a notebook of golf wisdom and anecdotes that he  compiled with the idea that he'd pass it on to his son. But, for the sake of history, it's a good thing that he changed his mind. Contained in its 175 pages is just about all you need to know about golf from a technical standpoint, along with Penick's priceless memories of working with famous pros, teaching absolute nobodies to get the ball in the air, and finding a horde of bat guano and hauling it across town in a pickup truck to fertilize his golf course. This book makes you feel good about playing golf, that you're part of something steeped in ritual and mystery and tradition, and that the game was played perfectly well before perimeter-weighted, graphite-shafted irons came along.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",10.99,"{'also_bought': ['0671612972', '0767903447', '0671723014', '068480364X', '0743267125', '0385504462', '0684867354', '0684867338', '1439195285', '0385500246', '0684845083', '0689116306', '0684800594', '0600623432', '1592406602', '0976017407', '0061860921', '0743212134', '0312354819', '1592407501', '0671871889', '068483040X', '0446529311', '1401309615', '1592408222', '1592402925', '1603200010', '0736084347', '0385477767', '0743273575', '074324107X', '1451650167', '1592401570', '0385424191', '159240202X', '192706905X', '0312280688', 'B007CT1KHY', '0553061941', 'B00261TWDW', '630310357X', '0821261851', '0743269756', '0978750209', '0743508092', '0061672823', '0743492471', '1616081120', 'B0076NU626', '1479123943', '1618930214', '1592407706', '1401302785', '0684864029', '159240510X', '0374105235', '1592408451', '0470882794', 'B000CNFC76', 'B00IRF3S2W', 'B0019GKDTM', 'B000KGAFDQ', '0062073478', 'B0013E2ARI', 'B00A35CS2U', '1401307787', 'B002WM0R5C', 'B0055NRJLA', 'B009MA0TR8', 'B00BIZPXWQ', 'B00D2PMP8A', 'B003UO5QSY', 'B003DXLO7Y', '055380684X', 'B00HV0NPVS', 'B001B6CH0S', '0310339308', 'B00IR8DG3K', 'B003D6FFXK', 'B008DFNX6C', 'B003BF8NSM', 'B00B9ADD4U', 'B0055NW0WS'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0671612972', '068480364X', '0767903447', '0385500246']}",

Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text. Considering the importance of Delhi, the capital of the world's second most populous nation, this book deserves to be in most public and academic libraries.Harold M.

Newly revised and updated, this indispensable history of social libertarian thought now reaches into the 21st century&mdash;touching upon themes echoed in other recent titles, including Raj Patel'sThe Value of Nothing. Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&mdash;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&mdash;and less expected contributors&mdash;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He left school aged fourteen and worked for a number of years in the aircraft industry before embarking on an adventure - travelling to South Africa by road and supporting himself along the way by working in gold and asbestos mines. Bagley spent the Fifties in South Africa, working as a freelance journalist and critic, before moving to Italy with his wife, Margaret, and then to Guernsey. His first novel, The Golden Keel, was based on a true story overheard by Bagley in a bar in Johannesburg, about Mussolini's vast personal riches and the men who went looking for it. It was published in 1963 to great acclaim and followed by a further fifteen popular adventure ovels. Bgley's career spanned two decades and his influence can be seen in the work of several highly respected thriller writers. When he died, in 1983, his final novel, Juggernaut, was completed by his wife.--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",14.08,"{'also_viewed': ['1842320165', '1842320114', '1842320149', '0745140335', 'B002X4PXRQ', '1842320505', '184232019X', '0385149115', '1842320122', '0194216683', '0006157556', '0002215837', '0312001657', '0007304811'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0007304781', '0007304811']}",

By becoming unhappily entrapped in a railroad tunnel during an air raid, and then by moving carefully across hundreds of miles of French countryside behind German lines all the way to Calais. There, this lonesome British tank finally emerges to blow up a Nazi ammunition dump and its full complement of Panzers. Barrett adeptly represents the English, Canadian and Anglicized French and German accents of the all-male military cast of characters. His skillful reading heightens the tension of this World War II thriller and keeps the listener anxious to hear what happens next, rooting for Bert throughout the tale.  J.D.N.

A harrowing account of the effects of repressive government on the individual, the novel moves between China and San Francisco, New York and Paris as its protagonist examines his own ""old-fashioned patriotism"" during a trip to the West. Central to the character's psyche are the wounds left by his attempted ""reformation"" by the Communists, a process which at one point involves his being marched to the execution ground--and left alive while those around him are killed, to wait for the rest of his life for the bullet to find him. The scene on the execution ground is unforgettable, its shocking subject filtered through a careful and farseeing irony. Although the level of the writing is generally sophisticated, the prose is occasionally self-conscious or strained--but this failing in no way impinges on the book's greatest accomplishment, its inherent refutation of its own dire assessment of China today: ""A country that cannot produce a nobility of the spirit is a country that is doomed.""Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,,

As in his novel Shoeless Joe , in which a long-deceased baseball player sets up a game in a startled fan's backyard, Kinsella's title piece explores the shifting borders of reality as Flannery O'Connor's character Enoch Emery comes to life and moves in with his creator. The stories' themes and characters are often fanciful, sometimes verging on the bizarre--the survivor of a freakish crime, as in ""Oh, Marley,"" or a man who runs off with his daughter's teenage friend in ""Evangeline's Mother""--but in Kinsella's hands they become poignantly credible. Profiling a wife's long-buried resentments as reflected in her ""Driving Patterns,"" the author expertly sets a menacing mood. Narrated by the gunfighter's mild-mannered friend, ""Billy in Trinidad"" shows a sympathetic side of Billy the Kid. A disaffected baseball player finds true love in ""Butterfly Winter,"" a tale that evokes the magical realism of South American fiction, while a yuppie ruefully recalls his carefree '60s days and his hippie girlfriend in the endpiece, ""Mother Tucker's Yellow Duck.""Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",7.99,"{'also_viewed': ['0140083634'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0395453933', '0140083634']}",

British spymaster Tweed thinks one of his four European section chiefs is a double agent and possibly a sadistic mass murderer. Tweed treks to Germany, where one of his top agents was killed, obviously betrayed by the traitor. The Russians and East Germans, hoping to kill Tweed, lead him to Lubeck, home of mysterious philanthropist Dr. Berlin. Deliberately using himself as bait to flush the two-faced ""Janus,"" Tweed is saved from assassination in Lubeck only with the help of British agent Bob Newman. Eventually Tweed uncovers a Russian plotfostered by a tough-talking Gorbachevto flood England with heroin, which the Soviets assume will destroy the country. The interminable comings and goings of Tweed and Newman, one in England, the other in East Germany, are chronicled in clumsy prose, often like a bad translation (""She moved agilely but with grace."") and unintentionally funny ""Cunning as a fox, Markus Wolf.""). The unlikely plot and pat solution are matched only by Tweed's phlegmatic dialogue: ""We can't afford the scandal. England can't. Mass murderer a senior chief in the SIS. Not on, Bob.""

In the early 1800s, expositional scientist Dr. Alexander Brodie is busy developing a heinous device that extracts and preserves the souls of unsuspecting victims (many dug up from graves) for future use in experiments on other patients. Fast-forward to 1999, where this same device turns up being tested in public at showman Peter Dexter's ""Resurrectionist Expression"" performance, much to the horror of young Charles Kidd, Dexter's public relations guru. Dexter's shadowy display of ""studied theatrics"" quickly backfires when the crowd angrily overtakes the stage after several audience members lose consciousness and vanish. Running parallel is an eerie, captivating transcribed interview with Daniel Lowes, who attends Dexter's resurrectionist festival performance. He describes dizzying, nightlong heavy drug use, sex, mystery and graveyard antics, which, joined with the other dangling plot pieces, concludes with a surprisingly cohesive explosion. Not all of the narrative sparkles. Wallace scatters dull legal briefs , which contribute little more than a different font style. He has a vivid imagination, and his story intermingles the curious history of Edinburgh's underbelly of grave robbers and medical mischief with some present-day grotesqueries, but the many scattered subplots limit the potential for a truly chilling experience.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,,

Schulz, creator ofPEANUTS. ""My ambition from earliest memory was to produce a daily comic strip."" And that was exactly what Schulz did everyday sincePEANUTSdebuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950.Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 26, 1922, Schulz was nicknamed ""Sparky"" after Barney Google's horse ""Sparkplug."" He began his fascination with comic strips early, reading the Sunday comics from four different newspapers with his father each week. With encouragement from his father, a barber, and his mother, Schulz enrolled in a correspondence course in cartooning at what is now the Art Instruction School, Inc. in Minneapolis.His career in cartooning was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the Army and soon embarked for Europe in the fight against Germany. Upon his return, Schulz landed his first job in cartooning atTimeless Topix, a Catholic comic magazine. Soon after, he took on a second job as a teacher at Art Instruction, where he worked with Charlie Brown, Linus and Frieda, who later lent their names to thePEANUTScomic strip.Schulz's first break came in 1947 when he sold a cartoon feature called ""Li'l Folks"" to theSt. Paul Pioneer Press.""Li'l Folks"" ran as a weekly feature for two years. In 1948 he sold a cartoon panel to the Saturday Evening Post and would go on to sell 15 more panels between 1948-50.In 1950, after many mailbox rejections, Schulz boarded a train from St. Paul to New York with a handful of drawings for a meeting with United Feature Syndicate. On October 2 of that year, PEANUTS, named by the syndicate, debuted in seven newspapers. When asked if he thought the strip would be a success, Schulz replied, ""Sure, I thought it would last; in fact, when I started out I thought, 'I'll be drawing this for the rest of my life.'""Almost 50 years later,PEANUTSappears in over 2,600 newspapers worldwide and Charles M. Schulz has become a household name. The strip has maintained its universal appeal throughout five distinctly different decades. ""As a youngster, I didn't realize how manyCharlie Brownsthere were in the world,"" said Schulz. ""I thought I was the only one. Now I realize thatCharlie Brown'sgoofs are familiar to everybody, adults and children alike.""Schulz would work six weeks ahead on daily and Sunday strips and, unlike many cartoonists, drew every comic strip without the assistance of an art staff. He also wrote all the scripts and storyboards for thePEANUTStelevision specials, earning him five Emmy and two Peabody Awards, and was involved in all aspects of thePEANUTSpublishing and licensing programs through United Media Licensing in New York. His company, Creative Associates, was formed in 1970 to handle his business affairs and assist in maintaining the high qualitystandards associated withPEANUTS.Obviously, even after producing almost 18,000 comic strips, Schulz remained dedicated toPEANUTS. When questioned about the overwhelming devotion to his work, Schulz explained, ""Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."" Among other numerous honors, Schulz received two Reuben Awards from the National Cartoonists Society (Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Humor Strip) and was inducted into the Cartoonist Hall of Fame.Although the strip remained his first love, Schulz was an avid sports enthusiast with a long-time passion for golf (he regularly participated in the Pro Am at Pebble Beach, California). He also enjoyed tennis. Above all, he loved ice-skating and the game of hockey, and was the only non-hockey professional to be presented the coveted Lester Patrick Award for his contributions to the game.

Although his girlfriend  is pregnant, he's got no major personal problems--until the day he  rolls into a small town called Furnace, where a middle-aged woman  pushes a baby carriage straight into his wheels and then vanishes. The  dead baby's teenage mother and other passers-by swear the wind caused  the carriage to roll, and the police take Josh for a troublemaker when  he insists on writing a statement to the contrary. Shaken, Josh hits  the road again, only to find that it's not so easy to get away from  Furnace; something inhuman is hot on his heels. A pretty hitchhiker  recognizes a mysterious scrap of writing in his truck as ancient runes  spelling out--on human skin--a horrific curse. From then on, all roads lead back  to Furnace as Josh races to unscramble a weird puzzle involving a  wealthy town councilor, the Philosopher's Stone, and a demon who will  destroy Josh in three days unless he returns the runes to their  rightful place.The rotating point of view can be confusing, and the language (Gray is Scottish) occasionally doesn't ring true to an American ear.

As symbols of fertility, they are present in mythology  worldwide, from the creation myths of Tibet, China, Korea and India in  the East to the classical myth of the birth of Venus in the West. They  have long been the subject of popular sea ballads and chanties, and  have inspired works of music, literature and art by many a brilliant  soul, including Franz Joseph Haydn, Oscar Wilde, T.S. Eliot and Paul  Gaugin. A subject of feminist history and women's studies, mermaids  have been represented in popular culture in many forms: advertising,  music videos and successful Hollywood films.This lavish gift book,  replete with many special features, including vellum pages, metallic  ink, an enchanting gatefold, a fortune-telling mermaid and a mermaid  tattoo, is a tactile, enticing trip under the sea. Author Theodore  Gachot discusses the archetypal appeal and multifaceted symbolism of  the mermaid -- as goddess, heroine, fertility symbol and ocean spirit  -- throughout time and across cultures.

Likewise, few readers will be tempted by the second installment's ludicrous intrigue involving the Chinese government's attempts to find and kidnap the newly reincarnated, British-born Dalai Lama. A former political adviser to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, Dobbs seems to have gone soft since New Labour took power, if Goodfellowe's soap-operatic midlife crisis is an indicator. With his wife hospitalized for depression, his teenage daughter hiding family planning and pregnancy leaflets and his junior ministerial career over, Goodfellowe is totally unprepared to be enlisted by Buddhist monks in the search for the next Dalai Lama. Dobbs delivers plenty of international cat-and-mouse episodes, stretching from London's Chinatown to Tibet, along with scenes of Chinese human rights abuses that would alarm Amnesty International, but none of this adds up to much of a read. Although there are good guys to cheer for and baddies to boo in the race to find the special child in England's Tibetan refugee community, this featherweight entertainment has no punch.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.",8.89,"{'also_viewed': ['1492606677', '1492606642', '1492606618', '0006477100', '0061099775', '1471111512'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['1492606677', '1492606642', '1492606618', '1847393241']}",

It is more than just a pretty book to set on the coffee table; this is a book cooks will enjoy and one that makes good reading if you are planning a trip to Italy.Fred Plotkin's text covers the history, economy, and particular ingredients important in each of Italy's culinary regions. He also explains how changes in the way Italians live are affecting how they eat. Meals, for example, now follow the traditional structure less rigidly in most parts of the country, with the southern areas holding closest to the old ways. Also, while cooking in Italy is still remarkably regional, people are enjoying recipes less tied to their locality. Use of fresh and local ingredients, however, remains strong.The recipes are by Lorenza De' Medici, who also did the food forItaly, the Beautiful CookbookandTuscany, the Beautiful Cookbook. Here she offers 220 dishes. Some show how Italians are modifying classics; others illustrate the living quality of Italian cooking in its acceptance of new ingredients and in new ways of using familiar ones. Perfect examples of this are Eggplant with Yogurt and Mint and Rice Salad with Pesto.

McDonald, garden editor of Houston Life, provides beautiful pictures of blooms, foliage and fruits, accompanied by brief sections of text written in an authoritative, somewhat off-putting prose that tends toward hyperbole: ""Roses have set the standard for redness from the beginning of recorded history."" In each volume, the color range is quite broad, so that Red embraces the ""rose-purple spikes"" of the obedience plant and the yellow-orange brilliance of the Gloriosa daisy, while the silver foliage of dusty miller is included in Blue. Unquestionably pretty to look through-the photos were taken mainly at nurseries and public and private gardens in the U.S., Canada and England-and likely to spark ideas in a gardener's mind, the volumes nevertheless disappoint by scanting such crucial considerations as appropriate planting zones (the flowers featured tend to favor hot climates) and other plant-specific requirements. Each volume includes a packet of containing three or four varieties of color-selected seeds, enough for a 1'35' ""border"" (i.e., two windowboxes).

Set as usual on Jeffries's home island of Mallorca, it features fair-play detection and (more importantly) keen observation of the human species. When the body of a retired Bolivian diplomat is found floating facedown in his swimming pool, Alvarez suspects the death was no accident. When he begins receiving calls threatening his life if he doesn't drop the case, he knows he's on the right trail. Then the unexpected occurs, proving family bonds are stronger than bureaucratic torpor. The simpatico Alvarez bases his conclusions not on fantastic deductions or painstaking forensic evidence but on patient and profound insight into the human soul. Like Maigret, he savors a case, displaying tolerant bemusement at human foibles. (""Why did modern youth enjoy hairstyles which made them look as if they were suffering from alopecia?"") In addition, there are nice touches of local color throughout. (""The bay backed by mountains and marshland, the cerulean sea, and the curving beaches of sand, pebbles, or rock, were still beautiful despite the marina, flats, restaurants and stores selling kitschy goods and the holiday camp which looked as if it had been designed by a French bureaucrat."") In sum, the style is pleasing, the detection inspired and the novel, as a whole, sometimes tragic but never dispiriting.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,,

Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by ""the mistress of mystery."" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. ""The Harlequin Tea Set,"" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in ""The Love Detectives,"" a little-known story about a messy love triangle. Mr. Parker Pyne, Christie's goverment statistician turned detective, is called upon to save a love-struck young man in the title story. Also included is a mystery involving the eccentric and slightly pompous Hercule Poirot. The audiobook is narrated by Jonathan Cecil, whose superb vocal adaptations greatly enhance Dame Agatha's work.

0002237814,,,[['Books']],Raise the Red Dawn,"Davis's ( Blind Prophet ) latest effort to cash in on the popularity of military techno-thrillers involves a Soviet submarine that becomes helplessly frozen in an arctic ice cap. Both Soviets and Americans race to recover the sub, which is carrying a revolutionary new superconductor, iriniump. 65 . This novel offers plenty of action, but the writing is unintentionally funny. It's hard to believe that an author could put these words into a character's mouth: ""I used to walk five miles to school in weather like this. . . . Used to say it was colder than a witch's left tit. Damned if I ever knew why the right one was warmer."" Or this, when a polar bear approaches a female CIA agent on the ice cap: ""With a sinking feeling, Justine realized she was not alone."" The characters are stereotypes straight from central casting, including the absent-minded professor, the evil Soviet sub commander and the beautiful female spy. Davis even manages to include two lovemaking scenes, which severely strain the credibility of his story. One of these scenes takes place in an empty torpedo tube while the father of the woman guards the couple's privacy.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",11.04,"{'also_viewed': ['0312169280', '0553294628', '055326205X', '0671769049']}",

As glimpsed through the fine nostalgic mist of Jones's camera, the root swells a Mediterranean fish stew; stuffs golden fowl or green chilies; or lies au naturel , pending baking or roasting. Among the most appealing recipes are the simplest: in roasted balsamic potatoes and onions, recommended as an accompaniment to red meats, the contenders are oven-roasted first in olive oil and then in seasoned balsamic vinegar; in rosemary potato skewers, potato chunks are boiled, dredged in herbs and spices, and grilled on charcoal. But if the potato lends itself to these visceral pleasures, it can also sneak into upper-crust tarts without suffering. (And even into hummus--where, one suspects, it may languish.) Waldron, trained at La Varenne, offers appetizers, side dishes and main courses in her brief book, a new entry in Collins's attractive Country Garden Cookbook series, and even offers advice to the amateur grower--but omits desserts, where potatoes can give depth and moist substance, if not pungence, to tortes.

Turner, a folklorist and lead singer in an all-women rock band, asserts that Madonna has invaded the psyches of women as a symbol of fearlessness, sexuality free of shame, and self-realization. The women whose dreams she records include homemakers, teenagers, grandmothers, a professor and a banker. Some dream of rescuing Madonna from danger; others dream of making love to her; in one dream the pop star is a policewoman. To most of the dreamers, Madonna is a sisterly companion or empowering friend. The collages, in a surreal style highly reminiscent of rock 'n' roll album cover art, reinforce the overhyped notion of Madonna's ""liberating sexual self-centeredness."" 35,000 first printing.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.",,"{'also_bought': ['1593764294', '1576874818'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0312117825']}",

You'll feel more than that after browsing through this nostalgia-soaked photo-biography. Combining wonderful vintage photographs with a brief autobiographical narrative from Roy himself, the book chronicles the storybook life of one Leonard Slye, a Depression-era teenager when his family left their Ohio farm for a dust-bowl journey to California. Only a few short years later, Leonard had become Roy Rogers, ""King of the Cowboys,"" and was launched on a career that would encompass 81 movies, a TV series, and hundreds of radio performances and recordings.

The protagonist, Hong, is a high-ranking policeman whose stubborn honesty leads him to investigate, unofficially and at growing personal risk, the mysterious death of his friend and mentor, while at the same time he is officially tailing a visiting American psychiatrist presumed to be a spy. Hong's investigations take him on a journey through the past that ends with his expose of treachery and crime among Mao's closest associates, the ""tigers"" of the Revolution. The novel's chief strengths are its intensely realistic depiction of a Peking bureaucracy, wherein those with the strongest noses for ""spiritual pollution"" appear to be the most corrupt, and Hong himself, a sympathetic and credible figure caught in the toils of sordid events. Its weaknesses are a pedestrian style and characterization that, Hong aside, is somewhat lacking in depth and vibrancy. Nathan wrote Rising Higher and Amusement Park.

Like the forerunners in the series, this one is scaled oversize to accommodate not only color photographs of avocado pasta and tomatillo soup, but also of the local landscapes, such as a Native American powwow and New Mexico's San Juan mountains. As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers).

Food scholar Ayla Aygar's comprehensive essay on the culinary and geo-political history of the Mediterranean region introduces the seven chapters, which are organized around courses and types of dishes, and feature recipes from each culinary tradition. Interspersed among chapters are shorter essays discussing the culinary heritage of each region. The recipes, which generally suggest variations found in other countries (and are an etymologist's delight), are uncomplicated, gracefully written, accessible to the American home cook and highlight the area's abundance of vegetables and fish. Of particular note are the chapters on soups and fish, ranging from the simplicity of Turkish grilled swordfish to Sicilian stuffed squid, and including four variations on a Moroccan fish marinade. With 250 photographs, this volume is also a feast for the eye.

She is its voice, even when the impossible choices which faced people at the time force her to be complicit in the destruction of her own language ...

Author Kenneth Pople has utilized the wealth of information about his subject to produceStanley Spencer: A Biography, a scrupulously researched examination of the complicated artist. Though Spencer's art had fallen out of favor in the years following his death,Stanley, the award-winning play based on his life, has renewed public interest in the man and his work, making Pople's biography timely, indeed.Stanley Spenceris divided into 47 chapters, each one concentrating on a specific painting, through which Pople attempts to illuminate a particular period of the artist's life.  He is especially strong at analyzing the work itself, but less so at breathing life into the people who surrounded Spencer: his family, wives, mistresses, and friends. Nevertheless, Kenneth Pople has brought valuable new insights to the work of Stanley Spencer, a gift for which art lovers can be grateful.",,{'also_viewed': ['071483890X']},

All but one of the deceptively short pieces were originally published in Saturday Night magazine and have as their subject matter quite commonplace objects and activities of everyday life. Visser's forte is to take the ordinary and turn it into the extraordinary by providing a cultural history of its evolution (each piece has a bibliography). The practice of showering, for example, was considered dangerous and became habitual only in the last 40 years, after central heating. Until the 1900s, when they established themselves as ""professionals,"" doctors and lawyers accepted tips in the same manner that waiters and hairdressers do today. The concept of paid vacations has its roots in 1920s fascist Italy, where workers were ordered to take time off to exercise their bodies. An insightful volume that will delight both fans and newcomers to Visser's writing.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,"{'also_viewed': ['0865476187'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0865476187']}",

Chef and cooking instructor De'Medici ( Italy the Beautiful Cookbook ) here focuses on the relatively small region of Tuscany, where a splendid--and vast--tradition in cookery has flourished for centuries, based, she writes, on a simple ""love of wine, freshly pressed olives and bread."" Well organized by menu course, the cuisine represented here is rich in fragrant soups fortified with crusty country breads and polentas made with chestnut or garbanzo flours. Some of the most interesting recipes include fresh tuna with peas, stuffed zucchini flowers and a squid and beans dish.

Being about Gilbert & George, the salacious material is fairly unorthodox--the most shocking revelation is that George married as a young man and has two children--and for the most part Farson is almost apologetic about any intrusion into Proesch and Passmore's (their surnames) private lives. The first half of the book takes us from their childhoods in the Dolomites and Tiverton via their meeting at St. Martin's School of Art in the late 1960s to their current status as art icons. The second half sees Farson following them around--Moscow, Shanghai, Barnstable--as they exhibit around the world. Farson wisely highlights his admiration at the outset, and the reader is clear that this is no hatchet job. That said, he covers both the art and the lives with a straightforward professionalism that is never less than absorbing. This book is a fine tribute to Gilbert & George; equally, their closing words are a fine tribute to Farson: ""On 27 November our dear Daniel died, not knowing how much we loved him (though we told him often enough).""--Nick Wroe",,,

Recaptured, Pitt and Giordino are sent to Kazim's desert slave camp, where they find Eva and her team--marked for death. A deadly trek across the Sahara is their only hope. Cussler champions ecological issues with verve, and continues his love affair with history by tossing in a Confederate ironside stranded in the Sahara near the remains of an aviatrix lost during the '30s. Some judicious cutting might have improved the narrative, but it's great fun nonetheless, putting Beau Geste swashbucklers against the vilest of villains.

Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her ""fairy-tale"" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

Both are celebrated inProvence the Beautiful Cookbook, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book authorRichard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made. Wine information and a glossary conclude the portrait of Provence and its table--a feast for the eye and palate alike.--Arthur Boehm",19.7,"{'also_bought': ['0002154129', '0002550326', '0002553708', '0002550296', '000215854X', '0681152710', '0002553481', '0681152672', '0002551519', '0020100604', '0002159317', 'B000ELJ3R6', '0002250357', '000215949X', '0002154463', '0681152699', '0002553724', '0895351854', '0060169222', '0848725824', 'B00A7KUYNQ', '1580083854', '0684815699', '0060507829', '0002551152', '0544242203', '0060580313', '0681047968', '0894806238', '0067576001', '0764542613', '0067575951', '0681152680', '0067575862', '0681047976', '0307718344', '1883283205', '0002250535', '0681152664', '0060971959', '1564582922', '0688089631', '0811846466', '1904943713', '0865474796', '1580084001', '0681152788', '0471262889', '000255464X', '0671203657', '0062088912', '0067575897', '0393020436', '0684800284', '1579655343', '086547480X', '1892145502', '0679738975', '0868672505', '0848725913', '0880015047', '076457602X', '0811812359', '006123883X', '0804839905', '0067575870', '1577193679', '1566562260', '0618875530', '0067575935', '1455525529', '0375405062', '0375413405', '0061373265', '002513955X', '0547508042', 'B000ESSRNU', '0002159996', '0067575900'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0544242203', '0002154129', '0002550326', 'B00A7KUYNQ']}",

And its great merit is to remind us that at the centre of all the dynastic wrangling, political conspiracy and media speculation stands a man who has often felt very alone.' The Economist'FOR more than 40 years a veil has been drawn over one of the most tragic episodes in the life of King Juan Carlos of Spain. Just before Easter 1956, his brother, Alfonso, 14, was shot dead with a .22 calibre pistol while the 18-year-old Juan Carlos was alone with him. The king's authorised biography made no mention of the incident. But light has been shed on it by Paul Preston, a professor at the LSE, whose biography laying bare the king's private life has reached No 1 in the Spanish bestseller lists. Preston's book has caused a furore by suggesting the future monarch may have pulled the trigger. It says he admitted to a friend he had been holding the gun at the time. The professor has given more than 60 interviews to the Spanish media and has been bombarded with hate mail and death threats.' Sunday Times, 11 May 2003'The lights and shadows of the life of Juan Carlos are reproduced with scientific precision. Preston's scalpel has been implacable... A lucid, penetrating, accurate book, backed up with an arsenal of facts... A scientifically admirable work that once more sees one of the great European historians flexing his muscles.' Luis Maria Anson, La Razon'A splendid book which, as an unauthorised biography, offers both a panoramic view of contemporary Spain as well as providing profound insight into the role of a King in the late twentieth century... The book provides a magnificent mosaic to solve the riddle that is the Spain of the last seventy-five years.' Marius Carol, La Vanguardia'Preston's Juan Carlos is much more ambitious than a mere biography. I must confess that it is a long time since I read a six-hundred page book at a sitting. This is one of the books that, after thirty pages, you just know that you either stop or let yourself be carried on right to the end. It is not only a model biography of the King but also a detailed, quietly erudite, history of Spain from 1931 to the present, rich in anecdotes, written with magisterial literary skill.'

""His films . . . are machines for delighting us,"" Baxter continues and then tells us how those machines are put together. Exploring the filmmaking, a portrait of the filmmaker emerges. Spielberg, notably comfortable with the idea that a hiqh-quality motion picture can be entertaining and vice versa, has met with so much commercial success that his artistic successes may be overlooked.

Artist Money (Anna Pavlova, 1982) stumbled into dance photography in the early 1960s after seeing the first televised performance of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. For the next several years he accompanied the dancers on tour and, against the constant objections of the two photo-phobes, managed to record them together in rehearsal and onstage. Many of the black-and-white images included here have never been published before, and they afford both a charmingly informal glimpse of the two artists and a record of the emotional power and style that made them sellouts at the box office. Most of the photos are maddeningly uncaptioned, but one picture of Fonteyn doing her tendus in a stone archway in Athens seems innocuous enough until one reads in the accompanying text that a workman had just missed bashing her head in with a beam. In the same series, we see Fonteyn stitching a toe shoe while Nureyev looks on; the young dancer had just announced that he would not dance that night. ``Perhaps we'd better just give the money back?'' Fonteyn replied calmly, stitching away. Unfortunately, we get few such intimate anecdotes and no real understanding of their working relationship. Fonteyn was an aging star, whom the Royal Ballet management was ready to shunt aside, Money tells us. Nureyev was a fiery young dancer, a recent defector from the Soviet Union. He renewed Fonteyn's career, even dared her, according to the author, to surpass herself. The magic of that interaction is missing from Money's text. But it is very present in his photos: Fonteyn's remarkably youthful Aurora exults in the arms of Nureyev, her Prince; as Romeo and Juliet they evince innocent love tragically betrayed. Both Fonteyn and Nureyev outdanced the usual span of a dancer's career; both died too young. Money's photos and sketches remind us of the way they were. --Copyright &copy;1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Vilified by his fellow Victorians for his sexuality and dandyism, these days he is hailed as a sexual liberator. Yet this is not how Wilde saw himself. His lifestyle and pretenses did not bring him happiness and fulfillment: his art did. And this is where Pearce's search for the man behind the masks is centered. Rather than lingering on the actions that brought him notoriety, Joseph Pearce explores the emotional and spiritual search of this fascinating and complex figure.The Unmasking of Oscar Wildereveals how his ""heart of stone"" was broken by his two-year prison sentence, while it probes the deeper implications of his masterpieces.

Two days after the funeral of her husband, Frank, Ellie feels immobilized by grief. Then the respectable Mrs. Dawes rushes to Ellie's door to announce she's just discovered the body of a young man at the church altar. Ellie soon becomes involved in the mystery surrounding the victim's murder, the subsequent disappearance of his mother and the disturbing quarrels of the young couple next door. Simultaneously, she examines her own life and, with a new confidence and strength, is able to stand up to Frank's bullying aunt Drusilla and her own spoiled daughter, Diana. Life without Frank will not be as predictable and safe, but it will certainly be more exciting. Heley's keen observations and insights into her characters create a rich atmosphere of the social life in an English town where, as reflected in the inviting pastoral jacket illustration, folk work in the local charity shop, go to the greengrocers and stop for sausages and mash at the Sunflowers caf . Combining sparkling wit and humor (particularly regarding Ellie's first attempts to master the computer), quirky acts of fate and a dramatic ending, Heley provides all one needs for a satisfying read, except perhaps a cozy chair, a cup of tea and some chocolate biscuits.

Set in Europe during various historical periods, the beautifully cadenced tales depict moments of insight or deep emotion, illuminated with unusual clarity. In ""The White Door,"" she imagines the last, bitter days of Mozart, unable to finish his Requiem or communicate with his gay and talkative wife, even to play the card games he adores. Alone, and in the final dark, he laughs aloud. Less poignant, but equally brilliant in detail, is the title story, in which an art dealer, obsessed with beauty, takes an arduous journey from Scheveningen to Copenhagen to sell to a Danish nobleman the Vermeer painting he cherishes almost as much as money. After both men die, the nobleman's daughter offers to return the painting to the merchant's son, who has inherited only his father's interest in matters financial. Like ""The Death of Ivan Ilich,"" the last of these stories, ""Order in the House,"" records the terrible struggle of a man, paralyzed by a stroke, to reenter life. Slowly his eyes begin to flicker with understanding, as spring brightens his window. But his wife, sho sits at his bedside awaiting the collapse of the useless body, never looks into his eyes. Compelling evocation of place and character and a rich prose style mark Morazzoni as a writer of exceptional talent.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",,,

Coming to the throne at the age of five, he ruled for 72 years and presided over the finest flourishing of French culture and one of its greatest periods of expansionist and military glory.

The book provides an overview of the entire civilization inspired by and reflecting the glory of the Sun King and so, while the character of Louis himself remains in the foreground, artists like Racine, Moliere, Lully and Mansart (the architect of Versailles) share the middle-ground with politicians such as Cardinal Mazarin and courtiers such as the King?s mistress, Louise de la Valliere.

The celebrated Belgian sleuth visits the sleepy English village of Warmsley Vale to check into the background of Gordon Cloade, supposedly a victim of the London Blitz. He had wed an attractive young widow, the former Mrs. Underhay, now the sole possessor of the Cloade family fortune. The deceased's sister-in-law told Poirot that ""spirits"" informed her that the widow's first husband is still among the living, raising suspicions about Cloade's demise. Fraser's tone at once reassures listeners that, just as on television, they are in capable hands.

Charming and mischievous, Sickert enjoyed a happy childhood, a stint as an actor that inspired his scandalous music-hall paintings, and marriage to a woman willing to support him even after they divorced because of his many affairs. Sickert's notorious sexual escapades run the gamut from romantic to pragmatic to farcical. Profoundly inspired by James McNeil Whistler and Degas, Sickert became a leader among radical British painters, an influential art critic, and a teacher. Sturgis' glowing portrait stands in stark opposition to crime writer Patricia Cornwell's extravagant claim inPortrait of a Killer(2002) that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Indeed, Sturgis makes short work of Cornwell's allegations after fully substantiating his portrait of Sickert as a revered artist whose joie de vivre, ""rare power of objective vision,"" frankness, and intensity revitalized the British figurative tradition.Donna SeamanCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Drawing for Beginners is a straightforward manual on the essentials of pencil and pens, charcoal, pastel, pen and wash, and conte. The usual animals, birds, people, landscapes, and buildings are covered. The strength of the book is its gathering of several contributing artists and the resulting broad variety of styles and techniques. Sketching presumes a certain level of skill and builds from there.

These two titles by British rosarians are evidence of this trend. Scarman, owner of an English nursery that specializes in old-fashioned varieties, presents a beautifully illustrated directory of 150 roses as well as chapters on plant design, companion planting (with examples of innovative combinations), and basic care. Although Beales, a commercial rose grower and daughter of renowned old-rose specialist Peter Beales, intended her Rose Basics as a general guide to growing all types of roses, she features many heirloom roses worthy of cultivation. Particularly useful is the chapter on roses for difficult conditions, such as shade and poor soil; such information is often neglected in basic rose culture guides. Because both of these titles were written for a British audience, they lack specific critical advice for American gardeners, i.e., appropriate rose selection and care for the highly diverse climatic regions of the United States. For such information, readers should turn to Rayford Reddell's A Year in the Life of a Rose: A Guide to Growing Roses from Coast to Coast (LJ 11/15/96) or Judith McKeon's Encyclopedia of Roses: An Organic Guide to Growing America's Favorite Flower (LJ 9/1/95). Nevertheless, these new titles should be included in general gardening collections.ABrian Lym, City Coll.

After picture framer/art dealer Theodor Marklund buys at auction The Madonna with the Dagger, this high-priced symbolic canvas, painted in 1919, is confiscated by tax officials. But then a shady art collector known only as ""Goatee"" returns the painting?or a forgery?to Markland. Others lay claim to The Madonna, including the son of the woman who posed for it, and Marklund's greedy ex-girlfriend. As Marklund's life spins into in a web of falsehood and deception, a similar fate befalls his friend Paula, a pop-music superstar who is having an affair with her plastic surgeon. Nothing is what it appears to be?not The Madonna itself, nor Marklund's artificial hand, nor the presumed suicide of Paula's manager, whom she may have pushed out the window. Loaded with scattershot allusions to Heidegger, Dali, Madonna, Baudelaire, Bach, Schopenhauer and Barbara Cartland, this post-Pop fable spoofs the mass media's fabrication of reality as it ponders the abyss between modern art and life.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",,,

Carbonetti had a surprise hit with her first book, The Tao of Watercolor. This one may also find a wide audience, despite its rather superficial use of Zen. It is a bold attempt, but those seriously interested in Eastern religion as artistic inspiration will be disappointed. Howard is a master of light in both watercolor and oil. Appointed Official Artist in Northern Ireland and a member of the Royal Academy, he is a stimulating teacher with strong views. Going from the sublime to the hideous, Jefferies's book on fantasy art will either stimulate the imagination or provoke nightmares.

Colin Mudford, an Australian boy, suspects that his parents favor his younger brother, Luke. When Luke collapses suddenly and is hospitalized, Colin wistfully imagines he has a malady of his own. Yet upon hearing that Luke will die of cancer, Colin sets out to find a doctor to cure him. Sent to live with relatives in England, Colin first tries soliciting the Queen's help, then approaches hospital physicians. He eventually meets Ted, a homosexual whose lover is dying of AIDS. Colin and Ted support one another through a difficult time (including Ted's assault by homophobic thugs), which enables Colin to shed his self-centered ways and allow a brave, resourceful and loving person to emerge. Gleitzman's liberal sprinkling of humor prevents the novel from becoming too dark. While the progression is slow at first, and several Australian expressions (""sooky,"" ""sticky-beaking"") may perplex readers, the material's topicality makes this a special book.

Chatto's vision of gardening is defined by two influences: plant ecology (""Plants have their preferences"") and Japanese garden design (""Surprise elements are necessary; shock tactics are not""). Chatto's passion is the play of shape, line and textureAwhich color may or may not enhance. But even more important is the garden's ecology of soil, light and air. After years of tracing garden plants back to their parents in the wild, Chatto knows the preferred growing conditions for individual species of perennials. This knowledge orders her gardens into habitats and her book into chapters: ""The Entrance Garden,"" ""The Water Garden,"" ""The Open Walks,"" ""The Shade Garden,"" ""The Dry Garden."" Amid what seems a crowd of plants, each chapter spotlights one or two of Chatto's favorites, such as hellebores, waterside grasses, ferns, euphorbias and fritillarias. This feature, along with a plant guide at the end of the book (where useful lists of companion plants join individual plant profiles), accompanies the lush, abundant photographs. A welcome reprise of the 1989 British title, this revision will suit American gardens in zones 4-7.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",,{'buy_after_viewing': ['0671670360']},

HarperCollins UK has compiled an inexpensive one that includes all the necessary components of a quality cartographic reference source: scope, relevance, clarity, readability, accuracy, a well-organized table of contents, and a comprehensive index. The arrangement of information includes sections on abbreviations, demographics, economic groups, international organizations, time zones, biology and climate, travel and tourism, world communications, and historical details. There is also a segment on how to use the book. Each map contains a cornucopia of data, including relief, boundaries, physical features, capitals, cities and towns, and historic sites and parks.

Cook's book on buildings is a good introduction to basic drawing tools and materials, with brief demonstrations and tips. The volume suffers from the smallness of many of the illustrations and the resulting loss of detail. An earlier effort by Michael Woods, The Complete Drawing Course: How You Can Master All the Techniques of Drawing in Just 25 Minutes (Batsford, 1995) is broader in scope and a better value. For those who want to render buildings in watercolor, Taylor's book is an unequivocal success. A member of the Society of Architectural Illustrators, Taylor has created a sumptuous work, rich in detailed images, and, moreover, complete with a brilliant text. For readers who wonder how a particular shadow is splashed over a stucco wall or how to get small panes in sunlight to look like real glass, Taylor reveals the color values and techniques necessary. Highly recommended, for beginning or advanced artists.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",15.24,"{'also_viewed': ['0713623314', '0715320947'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['1592537251']}",

Germany  challenged the Royal Navy's global dominance, the U.S. and Japan  established themselves as major naval powers. The revolutionaryHMS  Dreadnoughtwas succeeded by even larger and more powerful warships  that clashed spectacularly at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Plans for  a new generation of &#39;super dreadnoughts&#39; were delayed by  international treaties, but Japanese ambitions eventually led to a new  arms race with the U.S.. This naval race produced the world&#39;s  largest and most heavily-armed battleships, like theYamotoandOwa. Combat experience in World War II soon revealed that  submarines and aircraft posed a lethal threat to even the greatest  battleship. Only the U.S. Navy had the resources to maintain a  battleship force after 1945, and these mighty warships have attached  enemy coasts from Vietnam and the Lebanon to the 1991 Gulf War.Acclaimed naval illustrator Tony Gibbons has painted all classes of  twentieth century battleship forJane&#39;s Battleships of the 20th  Century. Every major battleship is shown in profile, with the 25  greatest battleships illustrated across the full width of the page,  with accompanying plan and bow views.Naval historian Bernard  Ireland reveals the fascinating background to each class of battleship.  Each entry includes comprehensive technical data. Special features  investigate what happened when battleships opened fire: Why British  battle cruisers were so vulnerable to German shellfire, how American  radar helpedUSS Washingtonsink theKirishimanoff  Guadalcanal and when was theBismarckdoomed to die.",24.41,"{'also_bought': ['0517378108', '0517679639', '1909160601', '0785829997', '0007105584', '1571452621', '1851703780', '0517234513', '0004720652', '0890096236', '1780192924', '0517679647', '158663044X', '1607101092', 'B00IWULSTC', '0754820920', 'B000MY628S', '0870217186', '1591146879', '1591143365', '1591146852', '0883653001', '0004721438', '1844763897', '089009084X', '0004708229', '184832085X', '0710609833', '8361220755', '2913903495', '836287807X'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0517679639', '0517378108', '1909160601', '1780192924']}",
