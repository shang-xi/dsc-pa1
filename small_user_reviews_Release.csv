It is a Jazz quintet line up of Alto sax, guitar, piano, bass, and drums. It sounds like it was all recorded live, no studio tricks here. The more I listened to it the more it grew on me.

AA7P2NEC94K79,B0062P7ISY,J. Pappan,"[3, 3]","I had a really good run with my free home phone using the ObiTalk and Google Voice... almost three years of 100% free, reliable service. That all ends on May 15, 2014, when Google announced it will stop supporting the XMPP protocol, which is used by the ObiTalk devices. It couldn't last forever, I think I knew that.The next cheapest alternative I found was the MagicJack. They advertisement $19.95 a year, but in reality, it's $29.95 a year. If you want $19.95, you have to sign up for five years, which I wasn't about to do based on the not-so-great reviews and uncertainty of the service. With this purchase on Amazon, you get six months free, which is a great way to test the waters.Here's how my four star experience went: (skip to the bottom to get the short version)- I purchased the product through Amazon, it arrived quickly in a fairly small but irritating package which had to be cut out completely like a children's toy in Wal-Mart. No big deal.- I briefly read some instructions, which weren't great. Essentially, I just plugged in the device to a USB port on my iMac (yes, I'm using OS X 10.9) and plugged in the ethernet cable from my router (both cables are supplied by MJ). My plan was to run the MJ by itself, not dependent on a computer. If you plan to do this, you must still start by plugging it into your computer.- Nothing happened on plugging it in. Upon going to the MJ website, I discovered that every link I clicked resulted in a page not found 404 error. Great, the entire website was down. After an hour I went to bed. Not a great start.- Next morning, the website was up. I eventually found the Mac software by going to magicjack.com and then going to the FAQ. The MJ website is set up to attract new customers, not to support existing customers. I found the Mac software and installed, but it failed to find the MJ device. So I started my computer in Windows mode, and found the Windows driver package. I installed the package, and it too did not work.- So I went back to Mac OS, and this time I found a driver package labeled ""2014 magicJack PLUS"" under Mac downloads. After installing this and running the application, everything started to work. It walked me through setting up my device and selecting a phone number. I chose not to port my old number because I simply don't care about it. I also know that it's not just $10 to port, but the reviews indicate it's a huge hassle, and there's a $10 fee every year, not just during setup.- I did elect the $3 to pick my own number from a long list. About 5 minutes later my MagicJack was good to go. I unplugged it from my computer and plugged the USB cable into the supplied power adapter. My MJ runs completely on its own, 24/7. I use the phone several hours a day for work, and I've yet to have an interruption. No one complains of delays, like some other VOIP services.At this point, if this continues, I will lock in for 5 years to get the $19.99/yr plan.Short version:This is an incredibly cheap landline solution for the cost. Customer support is not good. They are set up to attract new customers, not keep current ones. Don't port a number, unless you can't live without it - you get charged $10/yr forever for this service. Expect to use some trial/error getting it up and running. Expect to hunt around on a few different websites for drivers/answers. If you can deal with this, go for it. Once I got through the pain of getting my number set up, I have been loving the MJ.Don't forget you can take this thing on the road with you, and your number travels along.  You just need an ethernet port, power adapter and your phone.Something else to remember - it isn't easy getting the MJ to service every phone jack in your house. You can do it, but you need to know what you're doing (like, digging around in the phone box on the side of your house, beware). Out of the box, this will only provide service for ONE phone. In my case, I have it plugged into my portable phone base, and I have several other portables around the house that depend on the base and don't plug into any wall jacks. This is probably the best way to go.",4.0,Replaced my free ObiTalk/Google Voice phone with this,1399507200.0,"05 8, 2014"

A29VOXYNYSHU4O,0517209772,Paul Snow,"[8, 46]","Asimov mostly gives pretty standard skeptic views of the Biblical texts.He commits all of the typical errors of such skeptics.  For example, he gives an analysis of the resurrection of Jesus as an event that rests on the witness of a few women.  Never mind that the texts of those accounts are contradictory and contradictory between the Gospels, and the one quoted by Asimov is actually missing from the earliest manuscripts.A true analysis would never draw historical conclusions from passages that are unlikely to have been part of the original texts. Any research at all would have avoided such a gaff.  Heck, my own study Bible points out that these passages are missing from the earliest manuscripts.Furthermore, Asimov's guide treats the Bible as a single book.  And yet the Bible is a collection of books written over at least 800 years by 60 or more authors.  Heck, even what books should be included are not universally understood across various groups of Christians.  Catholics include 7 more books that western protestants. See [...]Wouldn't you think that Asimov might have discussed this fact?  Should he not have presented what we understand to be historically factual, and what we understand to be mythical?  Shouldn't his analysis include the observation that even the earliest Christian Writers, such as Saint Augustine doubted the literal interpretations of Genesis?  Or that the oldest books of the collection include Job, a book with four chapters of God lecturing Job that he knows nothing about how the creation of the world was accomplished?  Such insights are completely missing from this ""guide"".And to be fair, many, many groups have used these texts for various purposes.  The very first Christians refused to join any army or police force, based on the pacifist readings of such texts as the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew chapter 5.  The very first Baptists martyrs died demanding not just religious freedom for their own churches, but religious freedom for Muslims, Jews, and heretics (the common term in the 1600's for atheists).  And of course we have fundamentalism using the texts to oppose abortion, homosexuality, and evolution.  Does Asimov's guide give us insight into how some groups see religious freedom in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the roots of fundamentalism in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the pacifist and peace movements that arise from these texts?  No.A General Guide to the Bible ought to do some of this.  Should discuss how the texts have impacted history.  Should explain how the texts impact the present.  If you really want to understand the Bible in context, this book is useless.So what will you get if you read this ""guide""?  You will get the off the cuff observations of a cynical skeptic who (it seems) went out and bought a Bible, and dashed off many various common, unoriginal skeptic views to a few chosen passages into a very readable and engaging book.What you will not get is a researched, objective, fair, or insightful analysis of a library of religious and non religious texts that have done more to shape western thought, philosophy, and culture than any other collection of writings.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have been understood historically.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have driven various institutions such as the Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the Greek Orthodox Church, State Churches, etc.  You will not get the arguments for and against religious freedom, as found in these texts.  Or those over creationism.  Or over concepts like the trinity, or baptism, or communion.Really, you just won't get much.",1.0,A Guide for Those Uninterested in Objective Analysis,1357257600.0,"01 4, 2013"

They have already broken up so I don't see that happening anytime soon.  But I'm not saying I didn't like them while they were around. They put on great live shows.

And a lot of them have gotten very little recognition, such Revielle or the Phunk Junkeez.  3rd Stike pulls this off decently, but still have gotten virtually no recognition.

A2K2CHOLEUH4RC,B0090AAOUW,Dan the Saxman,"[1, 1]","I use my Note 2 as an MP3 player (I do a one man band show and need backing tracks) and needed a backup MP3 player in case the Samsung should fail.  After searching in the $100.00 or so price range I decided to take a chance with the I9220.  For the price of a decent dedicated MP3 player I like the extra goodies that comes with a smartphone.  I knew it wouldn't be a match for the Note 2, but since I really won't be using it as a phone I wasn't interested in it's 3G and 4G limitations.All I can say is that I'm impressed.  I loaded many of my Note 2 apps from the Google Play Store, which went without a hitch.  So far, no complaints on the headphone jack either, as others have commented on.  For people having a problem I suggest getting an iPhone adapter.  Early iPhones had recessed headphone jacks, and this phone likely requires such a jack.  I modified my jacks when I had an iPhone, so they work well with this phone.  Concerning sound quality out of the headphone jack, my preliminary tests show it has better sound than the Note 2.  I didn't expect that.  I need to do further testing, so don't hold me to this.  The onboard speaker lacks bass, but the volume is good enough.  The onboard camera is pretty bad, but I'm comparing it to the Note 2.Considering I paid over 5x's the price for the Note 2, I am very happy with this phone.  Time will tell if it will hold up, but for me it's just a backup device, so unless it goes bad while stored in a suitcase, it will likely last a very long time.BTW, whoever installed the screen protector did an excellent job.  Better than any I have ever installed.  I really didn't know it was on until I used a pair of strong reading glasses.UPDATE:  I just checked the ""about phone"" section on the phone and see that I got the GT-I9500.  No where does it mention the I9220.  Also, the baseband is MTK6515.  Android version is 4.2.2.  Whatever they call it, it's working great so far.  Lightahead was the seller, fullfilled through Amazon.For a good video describing this phone check: [...] or do a YouTube search for: N9000 DEMO1  My phone (black color) matches the phone shown with the on-off on the right side.  Also, mine didn't come with the ""comprehensive Android manual"" he mentions in the video.Update 10/30/13:  I took off one star for the viewing angle.  When viewing from the front of the camera, which is how I use it as an MP3 player, it's pretty bad.  My Samsung Note 2 kills in this respect, and you can see the difference in screen quality big time in this respect.  After extensive testing I can say for sure the audio chip in this phone is better than my in my ""real"" Note 2.  This has become my primary MP3 player, with the Note 2 being used as a backup.Sorry for not reviewing the phone call capabilities, and all I can say is it does work as a phone, since I tried it with my Note 2 sim card.  In all other respects it continues to work as a dependable device.  Maybe I just got lucky and got one of the ""good ones"".",4.0,Better than expected!,1381795200.0,"10 15, 2013"

Rowling presents us with ""The Half-Blood Prince"", a story with all the lightness of a lead coffin.While it is neither as plodding nor as cartoonish as its predecessor, this is no beach book.The few light interludes focus on the pleasures and pitfalls of romance--between witches, wizards, werewolves, and part-Veelas.The overarching atmosphere, however, is one of gloom, abounding in vivid descriptions of violence, pain, torture, and general bloodletting.In spite of all this, however, this book pulls off two nearly impossible feats; making readers feel some sympathy for the vile Draco Malfoy and giving them some insight into the grief felt by the earliest readers of Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop"" over thedeath of Little Nell.Rowling is often accused of being derivative, and, unfortunately, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" gives those critics plenty of ammunition.

It's pretty sad that after decades of making shoes, they can't fix this PROBLEM.For reference, I'm a 155lb, mid foot/heel 'glider' that's light on my feet and have used the shoes up to now for close to 20 hrs total use on moderate to technical trail.",4.0,Initially fit a bit small but stretched after time.,1375401600.0,"08 2, 2013"

This book was so stinking charming, I was completely swept away by it. No wonder the book has climbed to the quarter finals in the romance category of the 2013 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award. (More information: amazon.com/abna) I loved every single moment. The characters were charming, their lives were charming, the town of Saffron Sweeting was charming. It was so charming, I wanted to climb into the pages as I read and live among the characters. I wanted to walk into Grace Palmer's English cottage, ""put the kettle on"" and sit with her and tell her everything will be okay.The richness of the book reminded me a lot of Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes and the books by Peter Mayle set in Provence. If you love books set in a quirky little town with villagers that stake their claims on the story and a main character that struggles with internal conflict while falling in love with the beautiful but flawed surroundings of a town she haphazardly found her way to, then this is the book for you.Grace Palmer certainly received a punch in the stomach (not literally) in the opening pages when she learns of her husband's affair. But she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and returns to her home country of England only to find herself in the turmoil of changing times in the town of Saffron Sweeting.The people Grace meets in the town of Saffron Sweeting are all so wonderful as characters in a book. Each play a different role in Grace's life and each bring different elements to the storyline. What is so captivating about the story of this town is the mingling of two cultures. An American bio-tech firm is relocating American workers to Saffron Sweeting and the villagers who have always called Saffron Sweeting home are trying to adapt. Because Grace Palmer is the only person in town with insights into both cultures, she is quickly placed in the heart of the small town and must play the role of assistant, consultant and guide.I finished reading this book while on a weekend trip to Boston. I told everyone I saw on this trip about the book, even the passengers sitting on the plane beside me, imploring them to pick up a copy and start reading. It was that enjoyable, from cover to cover.Highly recommended. Run, don't walk. Or better yet, click.

AIFWCOS6FFYCV,B004VN09LM,Nathan Deunk,"[0, 0]","The Good:1. I didn't pay much.2. It holds the phone securely, whether in or out of the holster.3. When in the holster, it seems almost bulletproof.4. The felt on the inside was very soft and doesn't scratch the screen.5. It can slide into the holster face in or face out - although face out is much more difficult.6. It stands up and is quite stable in either orientation, which is the first time I've seen this in this type of case.7. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!The Bad:1. The phone jiggles EVER so slightly in the sleeve when it's not in the holster. It's still QUITE secure, but it could be annoying to some.2. Some people might have issues with the felt collecting dust, but I've been using it for 5 months in Djibouti and have had no problems.3. It doesn't protect the ends very well when you slide it out of the holster.4. While the plastic is grippy on your skin, on other surfaces it can be quite slick, so a tilted, hard, slick surface may not be the best place to put your phone.5. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!Conclusion: While I love the idea of the case, the sleeve didn't seem substantial enough to use without carrying around the holster, and the belt clip just gets in the way! I ended up snapping off the belt clip and doing an unconventional mod of the case. Turns out that if you take the button that holds the belt clip off and cut the felt in the middle, you can slide it in there and glue it down, which makes the holster much slimmer. However, this mod will ensure that you will never put any belt clip on it again. Good luck with your search for the perfect iPhone 4 case and thanks for reading!Update: I have used this case now for almost 5 months in the desert of Djibouti. After I snapped off the belt clip to make it smaller, it really worked well for me, providing just enough protection without feeling bulky. I highly recommend it, and it has become my favorite case for my iPhone by a large margin.

A3PV68UKJI1UVH,B002UAR8SK,K. Frazier,"[3, 3]","This netbook is great for a cheap small, very portable, tablet. Of course it's a netbook so expecting great performance, even out of the box, is just setting yourself up to be disappointed. I bought this netbook just over a month ago. I use it for school and simple things at home. It's good for research and note taking (I got MS office and I use OneNote on it). I use google chrome on it and it's pretty fast with this browser. I can't tell you how well it worked with the default RAM it came with because before I even turned it on I replaced the 1gb RAM stick with a 667mhz 2gb corsair stick I had bought that was shipped to my house the day before. I have had no problems with it, so no need to switch back. Like many other reviews for this netbook, I suggest you immediately upgrade to a 2gb stick of RAM.The design of this netbook is very nice (not as nice or as large as the t101mt, but I'll tell you why I chose this over the t101 later) and light. While it only has 2 USB ports you can get external add-ons (and if you need something that consumes power, then you'll need to get one that plugs into a wall outlet or has a battery pack). I have had no problems with the swiveling screen and while there is a long delay when using the button that changes the screen orientation, it's not difficult to use. The stylus is a bit annoying. It extends and will easily go back to it's normal position without having to make it (just hold it upwards). The 2 SD slots is a nice plus due to the lack of 3 USB ports. Not only that but one has a cover to make it semi-permanant. I assume this is done because there's not much hard drive space (only 32gb). The keyboard is difficult to type on first, but it doesn't take long to learn how to type on. because the keys are small it's very easy to ""fat-finger"" the keys when you type too fast (I do that a lot when I'm typing in my user-password and it takes it awhile to tell me that I typed in the incorrect password). I'm happy that they put a caps-lock LED indicator, and while they're not necessary, there are functions on the keyboard for num lock and scroll lock (some of the normal keys, when num lock is on, will function as a number pad). The camera is hardly worth mentioning. It's terrible. It's slow to capture and is 0.2 megapixels in picture capture mode. Though I didn't have a need for it in the first place so it's not a big con for me. The screen, while small, has a better PPI (pixels per sqaure inch) than most other netbooks. it's the same resolution as others but a smaller screen. That's one reason I chose it over the t101mt, also it's not very grainy.The touchscreen is nice, the multi touch features are mostly swiveling and resizing. I do recommend getting rid of some of asus' software like touchgate and the software dock. They're unnecessary and use quite a few resources (especially touchgate). However penwrite is useful, well, the t101mt version of penwrite is useful. I recommend going to the download page on Asus' website for the t101mt and downloading and installing its version of penwrite. that will allow you the option of getting palm rejection on every software, not just one note and a few other softwares. You do this by setting it into pen mode. Now there are a few problems I've had with it. When I have my palm rested on the screen while trying to write, it will reject everything, that includes whatever I'm trying to write with the pen (or draw).Now for overall performance in my very long review. Of course you can't expect too much, considering it's a netbook, but the intel GMA 500 is terrible, or well.. the intel GMA 500 DRIVERS are terrible. I can run video game emulators up to the graphics level of the SNES, however, when I tried playing megaman zero 1 (I'm a bit of a fan) on the visual boy advance emulator, on the second stage there is an overlay of what is supposed to be rain, however my graphics chip couldn't understand the overlay and completely omitted the game and just displayed the rain overlay which made it impossible to play. Now I tried the same emulator with the EXACT same rom (put the rom on a flash drive) and played it on my desktop and had no such problem. The emulator was also extremely slow. I've also had problems with visual clones of applications. One of which was a desktop gadget monitoring CPU usage and Memory usage. I was able to easily get rid of the clone by moving my mouse over it, forcing a reset of the sector of the screen the mouse was over. Now to increase performance, I recommend turning off windows aero and turning your graphics settings to either basic or classic (I'm using classic right now). I also recommend having it plugged in whenever possible for performance. Getting linux on here (from what I've read) is a nightmare. It mostly has to do with the linux graphics drivers for the intel GMA 500 being terrible (look up the Dell mini 10 ubuntu netbooks and search for articles relating to it not working). The reason it's terrible is that intel didn't actually make the chip, another company did and intel just puts their name on it. Now also to get it to work on linux, you have to compile your own driver so the touchscreen will work in linux. The first is a more difficult task than the second of course. I have had no problems with my after market memory. Of course with a processor operating at 1.33ghz, there are going to be programs crashing if you ask it to run too much (I had one note do that when I asked it to undo too much). The battery life is AMAZING. if I use it conservatively with low brightness settings, it lasts about 5 hours (on power saver mode). about 3 hours if I play music or video games (which is annoying if I'm playing chess with a friend).If you're going to listen to music, you should use headphones instead of the speakers. the speakers are on the underside of the netbook and also have low sound quality. Videos are a bit laggy (I get low frame rates on youtube on the lowest possible resolution) however I usually get no lag on sound (unless there's a high resource process running)the Bluetooth feature is very nice since I don't have a connector for my phone to a computer. The hard drive is slow (don't be fooled by the fact that it's an SSD) and only has 32gb (that's actually the marketed amount, there's less after formatting it to the NTFS filesystem, the true total is 29.7GB) of storage space. I don't store that many files on here and I don't have a lot of software and I only have 10gb remaining (while running piriform's CCleaner). I do highly recommend getting a high capacity SD card to store files on if you get this product. I would NOT use the online data storage asus provides, the interface for it has crashed windows explorer every time I try to set up an update with itif you have reached this far, I thank you and commend you for reading the entire review of this product.

The reason for this isthat this book teaches how to understand the strategic and positional ideas behind each opening.Without this knowledge, an opening is merely a series of meaningless moves, and the first time anopponent varies from book, one is left floundering for a plan, or some tactical solution which maynever be found. If this book is truly mastered, it is probably all a club player would ever need.But if concrete variations are desired, then it could be followed up profitably with MCO, or somesuch compilation of variations.

King,"[2, 3]","My original review can be found at: [...]The best summary of the message of Linchpin can be found on page 174:""You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable, insightful, an artist, someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.""This is, at some level, rather obvious, of course. Seth spends a lot of time explaining the gift economy and the lizard brain and what he means by making art. And all of this is pretty good stuff. But what it all comes down to is this: If you want to succeed as an employee, as an employer, as a person, you need to stand out from the crowd by exceeding expectations and giving freely your best work, even if less will do. Hardly earth-shattering stuff, but worth repeating.A problem Seth has with his books is that he rarely tells you how he thinks you can achieve the very high bars he sets. Just that you need to meet them. Somehow. This is a problem that Seth himself mentions in Linchpin:""One of my favorite negative reviews of my book Tribes: 'Godin doesn't explain how to go about doing the actual hard groundwork of leadership. He makes it sound like anyone with an idea and  a cell phone can rally thousands of people to their cause in minutes if they just realize it's not hard'. My response: Telling people leadership is important is one thing. Showing them step by step precisely how to be a leader is impossible.""Linchpin works the same way. He tells you that *being indispensable* is important, and why, but stops short of telling you how. That would be impossible. Which makes Linchpin much more of a ""get off your butt and do something"" inspirational-style book than a ""here's a bunch of things you can do to make your life better"" self-help book.",3.0,"Inspirational, but obvious",1270512000.0,"04 6, 2010"

A24BYG0GAFVQJR,0141331879,Criss,"[0, 0]","""Limitele spiritului"" este volumul 5 din seria ""Academia vampirilor"", carte care mi-a placut enorm de mult. A fost plina de suspans, actiune, emotie si iubire :) Rose isi da testele de gardian, in urma carora obtine cel mai mare  punctaj. Pur si simplu este fenomenala la acest capitol - de mi-ar fi si mie la fel de simplu la examen : )Oricum, ajunsa gardian,viata ei ia cu totul si cu totul alta turnura Problemele de aceasta data sunt mult mai grave, si sa va explic de ce. Rose are un nou obiectiv: vrea sa-l faca pe Dimitri, de fapt, nu-l face, si-l readuce la starea lui initiala de dhampir. Problema e ca secretul acestei transformari este detinut de Robert, fratele maleficului Vikton Dashkov, care acum este inchis intr-o inchisoare de maxima securitate. Chiar asa, Eddie, Lissa si Rose pornesc dupa Viktor, pentru a-l elibera din Tarasov - si chiar reusesc !Esentialul este ca pentru a transforma un strigoi in dhampir este necesar ca strigoiul sa fie ucis cu o tepusa vrajita de spirit, si sa-i fie implantata in inima de acelasi utilizator al spiritului. Intorsi la Academie, Rose si ceilalti (inclusiv Adrian care li se alatura ) sunt pedepsiti. Partea asta mi s-a parut pur si simplu enervanta - cu pedeapsa - nu ca ar fi vina autoarei, insa ma enerveaza genul de personaje care arunca in stanga si-n dreapta cu acuzatii si pedepse. Daca in romanele trecute Rose era aia care ascundea chestii de Lissa, acum situatia s-a inversat, Lissa fiind mica secretoasa.Tot acest farmec ar trebui sa aibe loc pana la urmatorul atac al lui Dimitri, insa se pare ca el loveste din nou, ca strigoi, si cu toate ca Rose si Eddie au avut ocazia sa-l omoare, Rose l-a impiediat - ce sa faci cand iubesti pe cineva intratat de mult ? Ca oglindire in lumea reala, am observat sa Rose este modelul dupa care ar trebui cu totii sa ne luam - mai mult sau mai putin -. Ea nu este perfecta. Daca in primele doua carti am zis ca este prea super-eroina, apoi se intampla mai incolo sa decada intr-atat doar din cauza iubirii. Oricum ar fi, pe un grafic al evolutiei, ea devine din ce in ce mai buna, mai priceputa, mai inteligenta simai ambitioasa(daca este posibil ) . Lissa, prietena ei cea mai buna, ii este mereu alaturi, si pot spune ca mi-a placut mult de ea.Nu am avut o parere prea buna in privinta relatiei Rose- Adrian deoarece, cu toate ca el este indragostit de ea, Rose nu-l iubeste cu adevarat.""Limitele spiritului"" a fost plina de actiune, avand un titlu ideal si extrem de sugestiv. Mi-a placut ! A fost foarte buna ! Si inainte de a incheia aceasta recenzie, va mai spun ceva: Dimitri o sa atace din nou. Iar de data asta .. oare il pot salva sau va trebui sa fie ucis ? Si mai mult, oare este reala toata aceasta chestie cu salvarea sau doar isi risca vietile personajele in mod iinutil ?",5.0,A wonderful book !,1357776000.0,"01 10, 2013"

Grace and Beatrice so obviously did.  This book is a brilliant illustration of how the system fails us.  (Although, I must admit, I'm not 100% convinced that Schlictmann wasn't at least partly to blame.  I think the big payoff was his ultimate motivation-and his greed was, finally, his downfall.)I also felt amazed at how Harr was able to create such excitement around every motion filed, deposition taken and objection sustained or overruled.  It was as compelling as any thriller I've ever read.  I'm no legal expert, but I can see how this book would be extremely useful to any first-year law student.  Harr's research is impeccable; he really brought the most minute legal and technical details to light in a straightforward and reasonably objective manner.In closing, while W.R. Grace and Beatrice sleazed their way through this debacle without having to admit guilt, the Woburn families affected by this tragedy can feel somewhat vindicated in that anyone who reads A CIVIL ACTION will surely be convinced that Grace and Beatrice are truly at fault.",5.0,A small victory for the people of Woburn,978480000.0,"01 3, 2001"

A350IYXKKU2LW1,0316154601,memomoment,"[0, 0]","Veteran crime novelist Michael Connelly is in fine form with ""Lost Light,"" his 2003 entry in the detective Harry Bosch series.The novel begins eight months after the Los Angeles homicide detective retired, as Bosch turns his attention to an unsolved case that still haunts him.Angella Benton was killed on her 24th birthday, in the vestibule of her own apartment building. Three days later, $2 million in cash was stolen by gunmen in a spectacular, and bloody, heist from a movie shoot overseen by the company where Benton was a lowly worker. After Bosch and his partners were pulled from the case, the new team never made any progress, and the case all but died when one of the investigators was killed and the other was paralyzed in a lunchtime shootout at a bar.Nearly as soon as Bosch starts tugging at loose threads in the four-year-old homicide, he discovers plenty of seemingly related irregularities, including the disappearance of a federal agent and the detention of a terrorism suspect. A former colleague warns Bosch to drop the Benton case, but it will take more than that -- and more than some strong-arm tactics by a secretive U.S. government task force -- to deter the detective...It's been years since I read a murder mystery, and my reintroduction to Connelly was a bit shaky at first. Although I remember having read and enjoyed one Harry Bosch novel, the writing at the start of ""Lost Light"" seemed flat. Soon enough, however, the story kicks in, and the book swept me up and took me along for the ride.Interestingly, the book seems a bit dated, and not just because Bosch is a confirmed technophobe who doesn't even own a computer, let alone know how to use one. ""Lost Light"" was written before the start of the Iraq war, and the book represents an effort by the crime novelist to wrestle with the tradeoff between civil liberty and security that has been an issue in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.That discussion is still relevant, but the issue seems strangely innocent and depoliticized in the context of ""Lost Light."" I noticed no mention of any political party or of the name of then-President George W. Bush. This seems remarkable given how bitter the discourse has been over him and his successor.And even though the federal government lavishes some unwanted attention on Bosch, I had trouble believing the detective was in genuine jeopardy. By contrast, Bosch seemed much more vulnerable during the parts of the book in which he attempts a reconciliation with his ex-wife.Still, this was a fun escapist read and worth the time.",4.0,Connelly weaves murderous web,1336089600.0,"05 4, 2012"

So for my chin, I had to angle it a bunch of different ways till it grabbed each hair. I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more open.Wow...it really hurts.

A1OME2PFEMOSFQ,B0000014RF,"Michael R. Powell ""digital_picker""","[0, 0]","Two problems exist when it comes to buying a soundtrack CD for this film.  The first, as with all score CDs it seems, is to make sure you don't end up with a bootleg.  Granted, it is simply a fact of life for score collectors that some material can only be found on these ""import""/""limited edition""/""promo""/""expanded"" score CDs, but the problem with bootlegs is that in the event of an official release, it muddies the market in terms of what is worth buying, and for what price.The other issue isn't necessarily unique to this film, but is just due to the combination of rock music and score pieces found on the original Varese Sarabande CD.  The short answer when it comes to what I'd recommend for anyone wanting a ""complete"" score for this film is to buy the recently-released Intrada CD.  However, for true completists it's not that simple.  The reason I've purchased the Varese Sarabande version and not the Intrada release is because Intrada did not include the rock tracks on their CD.  It may have been a licensing issue, or simply due to limited space.  Intrada's release of the Manhunter soundtrack also featured a track by Red 7, but I suppose these are licensed differently.  I assume it might just have been a matter of focusing on the score tracks, and for anyone who is a collector of score CDs that should probably suffice.For me, the goal was to obtain a properly-mastered version of the song ""Less Than Perfect"" by Red 7, since the CD release of their album on the Renaissance label was sub-standard at best, with ""Less Than Perfect"" being particularly affected by a lack of low end and what sounds like clipping distortion throughout.  I was disappointed to find that the version on this CD is somewhat remixed, so that it doesn't begin with the pumping bass line that started off the album version, and that the bass on this CD is only marginally better than that on the Renaissance release.  It's still nice to have, but not what I was expecting.  As for the score pieces, I could take or leave them... I never saw the film, but I do like electronic music, so some of the ""synth junk"" another reviewer alluded to might be appealing.The most important point to get across is that bootlegs of this and MANY other soundtracks abound.  As someone who has spent more than 20 years working in radio, the fact that these bootlegs are often labeled as ""promo only"" to avoid detection personally offends me.  If someone offers you a ""promo"" score CD, ask yourself ""why would a promotional CD of this material be issued?""  Remember that ALL promos come from the rights holders... there are NO ""unofficial"" promos, so if they're not released by the record company who owns the rights to the score, avoid buying them.  Obviously Varese Sarabande and Intrada license material from the rights holders, but even if a release appears to be from one of those labels, it's worth checking online to see if a particular title is indeed part of that label's catalog.  There are some very skilled graphic artists involved in creating fake score CDs, so you really have to do your homework and check out EVERYTHING.  As I said before, sometimes an unofficial release is the only source for some material, but in cases where official releases have been made, you could end up spending too much on a fake CD only to potentially find the official version later, possibly for a lower price.",3.0,"Avoid bootlegs, define ""complete"" before you buy...",1320105600.0,"11 1, 2011"

A14DV5W2N1EAJJ,1416572260,Daryl Anderson,"[112, 114]","If you are a real teacher (or principal or dean) in a real school, this humane and engaging book will surprise you with its combination of practicality and idealism. It will inspire you to change things and to believe in the possibility of change.After teaching for eight years, I have spent the last three as ""the discipline guy"", Dean of Students, in a small, rural middle school. As both teacher and now as dean I have developed a deep suspicion of a certain sort of books. You know the ones: written by theoreticians or one-on-one therapists who have never had to juggle a roomful of 25 actual young human beings with not enough time, not enough resources and far too much of paperwork, testing, and ringing bells; and more and more deeply-troubled youngsters. These are the books that anxious or angry and frustrated parents bring to meetings that tell them how you should be meeting the needs of their unsuccessful or disruptive child. These books make things far worse for everyone involved.""Lost at School"" is different; and that's clear from the beginning. After a brief introduction which pulls no punches in saying ""school discipline is broken"" the book launches into a story! Every teacher I know likes a good story - and this one feels so much like real (school)-life from the beginning that it sets the hook for the rest of the book. The different thing about this story is not the characterization of the troubled and challenging kids, but of its inclusion of the realistic range of adult personalities that combine to make education what it is - and sometimes isn't. The book sets out to follow the path of a handful of youngsters and another handful of fictional teachers and administrators who are struggling with the limitations of their own range of personalities and world-views as well as the real constraints of what schools can and cannot do. It is quite eye-opening and, in my opinion, dead-on accurate.Now don't let me give the impression that this book is just another entertaining ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""Room 222"" or even merely another inspirational ""Stand and Deliver"". ""Lost at School"" is ultimately focused on a suite of methods for understanding children who exhibit challenging behaviors in school and for working with them to help them change. The ""storyline"" serves as an opportunity to view those methods in action as used by some fictionalized but well-drawn characters.The core assumptions of Greene's approach are that behaviorally challenging youngsters (a) ""know how we want them to behave"" and (b) ""want to behave the right way"". They don't need us to keep depriving them of privileges or offering them rewards to learn these two bits.The basic premise of the book is that these youngsters lack specific thinking skills which make it difficult or impossible for them to behave in circumstances that come up too-frequently in their school lives. Much as education has come-around in the past 20 years to acknowledge that cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, must be acknowledged as part of a youngster's learning of reading or mathematics, we need to move to a similar approach with behavioral difficulties.The goal, then, for educators, parents and the students, is to identify these missing or lagging cognitive skills and help students develop them - as central parts of their education.  Greene provides an inventory which will remind educators of the sorts of rubrics we use frequently, for instance, in assessing students for attention or hyperactivity disorders. Some of these skills may well have come up in your conversations about a difficult student, e.g. ""difficulty handling transitions"". Some of them have probably been parts of conversations about students without the notion that they ought to be taught, e.g. ""difficulty considering likely outcomes or consequences of actions"". And some of them might just not have occurred to you as loci of behavioral challenges, e.g. ""difficulty taking into account situational factors that would suggest the need to adjust a plan of action"". Rarely, though, have you or I managed to systematically think about what to do with these anecdotal observations.Having worked through the assessment of lagging skills, the next task is to ""teach"" these skills. In this regard Greene shifts gears and does not provide a ""curriculum"". Instead he provides an approach - a way of communicating with behaviorally challenging youngsters that he terms ""Collaborative Problem Solving"" or CPS. Some might find this unsatisfying. I did, at first; hoping for a ""methods"" approach to teaching this as any other group of skills. But I found Greene's system ultimately satisfying and revealing instead. He gives us CPS and weaves his ongoing story of sixth-grader Joey into its explicationThe CPS approach is interesting because it sounds so simple. Greene calls it simply ""Plan B"";  distinguishing from ""Plan A"" - wherein the teacher or institution imposes its will on the student, and from ""Plan C"" in which we ""drop an expectation completely, at least temporarily"".  I have to compliment Green on boldly sticking to such a simple naming scheme instead of coming up with typical ed-psych jargon to describe his schema or its alternatives. But the real power of such a simply-named approach is that describing it reveals how much we are all rooted in bouncing between poorly-implemented versions of plans A and C as part of school discipline. The ""Plan B"" or CPS approach assumes and requires listening to and the meaningful participation of the student -- and that is revealed to be a deeply-buried skill of even the well-intentioned educators in the storyline. But it can be learned and is the key to making things work.Greene is very open to all the ways things can go awry in dealing with real kids in real school environments. He peppers the book with ""Q&A;"" sections, and sample dialogues. But central to his acknowledgement of the ""real world"" is his fictional one! He weaves in, throughout, the ongoing tale of Joey and Mrs. Woods; of the Assistant Principal who got knocked in the jaw by Joey back in chapter one; of Joey's anguished mom and even of Mr. Armstrong, the ""these kids just have to learn how to behave"" guy, whom seems so familiar to any educator. This side-story becomes in many ways a central one as all of these people move through a year of struggle and transformation.I won't tell you how it ends but will reassure you that it does end, as most school years to, not with a bang of disaster or triumph but with a deep breath and a look ahead as all the good but flawed folks involved anticipate the next year's labors. In this Greene manages to honor the motives and efforts of everyone who chooses to work in the often thankless business of education while he deftly reminds us of how much better we could and should be doing with these youngsters.",5.0,"Not the Usual ""fix my kid"" Book: Deeply Humane and Engaging",1227312000.0,"11 22, 2008"

I have to say that most books I review end with me telling you that it's a good book, but this is NOT the case this time. This is not a good book, it's a fantastic book!I consider myself pretty versed in HTML 4 Transitional code, but HTML 5 is a whole different monster. I looked at it a while back but it wasn't very mature at the time. Things have changed a bit now. There are more browsers that support it now and the support is much better. More and more websites are offering great HTML 5 content and there is some really amazing stuff I have seen it do. I just had to get my feet wet a little more.This book, the HTML5 Developer's Cookbook, is a great way to get into this new form of web programming. I really dig the whole ""cookbook"" concept, which has some well annotated and defined ""recipes"" for accomplishing different tasks. You get great directions on everything from HTML 5 basic layout, to HTML 5 forms and much much more. This book starts with some forward information on what HTML 5 is and what it is not, a little history and background. It follows with, basically, 2 sections. Practically half the book is devoted to straight HTML 5 layout, tags, element changes, forms, css and media embedding, and the second, more advanced half of the book covers a wide variety of very useful API's. Things like drag and drop support and SQL support all the way up through really advanced things like media capture and geo-location.It took me a long time to get through this book, mostly because i really wanted to try a bunch of this stuff myself and there are a lot of code examples (those recipes again).

It has a lot of recipes, and sometimes several variations of similar things (like several different stew recipes, several different beef stroganoff recipes, etc). It must have a few hundred recipes or more.  Each page has probably 4 or 5 recipes on it- it's really a LOT of recipes!! I like the variety and choice.  It appears the recipes were submitted by individuals, and I find most of the meals are more 'traditional' meals.  Many of the meals are hearty and heavy, and probably not the most health concious, but they definitely remind me of the kind of meals I grew up eating.Most of the recipes involve very little prep work, and you can just sort of throw the ingrediants in and go.  Some slow coooker cookbooks have you cook and prepare for 1 1/2 hours before you even start slow cooking- and  that sort of defeats the purpose for me.  I slow cook because I work a 9 hour day and commute 1 1/2 hours each way.  After being gone 12 hours, and getting home late, I can't always cook a full meal.  These recipes are so easy I can throw the ingrediants in the slow cooker  at 10pm at night and put the slow cooker in the refrigerator overnight.  Then, the next morning, I pull the slow cooker out of the fridge, plug it in and go to work.  Dinner is ready by the time I get home.This is a good beginner slow cooker cookbook.  It doesn't have anything in it that I would call innovative or groundbreaking, but it's a good place to start.

Starring Jeremy Sisto, it follows the life of the future Dictator of Rome from his relative obscurity to his death at the hands of his peers on the Senate floor on the Ides of March in 44BC.The story covers the highlights of Caesar's life including his exile during the rule of the cruel dictator Sulla, his patronage under the capable General Pompey, his brutal but victorious campaigns against Vercingetorix and the Gauls, and his love affair with the beautiful and scheming Egytian queen Cleopatra.  Caesar's great ambition ultimately lead to his own murder by members of the Roman Senate who fear his ascendency, but ironically bring about the rise of the Empire.There are many political complexities that are touched upon in this film that give a good idea of the kinds of power plays that lead to Caesear's rise and fall, many of them including betrayal and murder.  The film depicts the Gallic Wars in good detail and gives an understanding of the turmoil that faced the Roman Republic in its last years before the rise of the Empire.  Caesar is portrayed as a intelligent human figure who is struck down by tragedy and overcome with amibition which ultimately leads to his own death.  The irony of Caesar's murder is that it was ostensibly to preserve the Republic, but rather hastened the foundation of the Empire.

A2MRMWRVCRX1CT,1400204224,James R. V. Matichuk,"[11, 12]","My view of angels is complicated. I was raised in an evangelical home and have always believed in angels and the part they played in the biblical story; however I was taught to be suspicious of tales of modern day angelic visitations, and to doubt the lore which was built around angels, because so much of it was New Age, Mormons, or Muslim. As a child I was tucked in with a prayer that asked God to send his angels to look after me, but if anybody started talking about experiencing angels, that was a good indication that they were a heretic or they needed to up their medication.When I was in college, I attended a charismatic church which affirmed the experiential reality of a super natural God-everything God did in scripture was for today and that included angels and angelic visitations. I remember one guest speaker at our church explaining that he felt the presence of `angels in the room' by a sensation he had in his sinus cavity(yep, I kid you not). Others saw angels, or `felt them.' I did feel the reality of God's presence at that church but the lack of critical thinking about spiritual experiences was disturbing.Joel Miller has written a book on angels which deftly guides readers past the extremes of supernatural suspicion and belief in anything and everything `angelic.' Drawing generously on Biblical and patristic sources (early church theologians), he gives an account of how the early church thought and taught about angels. He asserts that `the image that forms from these sources is, I think, more exciting, more frightening, more humbling, more inspiring, and ultimately more real than our popular conceptions.(2)' Miller discusses the early church's reflections on the nature and origin of angels, their fall from grace (in the case of Satan and his demons), the ways God used angels to nurture and protect Israel, Christs victory over the demonic, the role of guardian angels in nurturing and protecting us, our participation with the angels in the worship of God, the role of angels in the eschaton.This is a lot of ground to cover for a short book (the main text of the book is 152 pages excluding footnotes and bibliography); nevertheless Miller succeeds admirably well in delineating the understanding of angels bequeathed us from the early church, even demonstrating the way our understanding of angels has developed over time. Certainly there are some aspects of early church angel-ology where I disagree or would want to parse biblical texts which deal with angels differently. But there is no denying, the tradition has a lot to teach us.  I would recommend this book for those who have an interest in angels (whether that manifests itself as an unhealthy fascination or dismissive suspicion).  Part of navigating how we are to understand something so mysterious and etheral as angels is by submitting ourselves to a biblical understanding of angels and drawing on the rich resources of theology.  Miller does both.The question that the discerning reader may have is, ""how does ancient exegesis shape our understanding of angels?"" Just because ancient Christians thought and taught something, does not necessarily make it right. This is a popular level study and does little in way of evaluating its sources. Miller simply sites church fathers he is sympathetic to(while noting theological diversity and doctrinal development).  The belief in the fall of Lucifer is found in the ancient church, but when you read Isaiah in its historic, literary context, the Biblical data doesn't seem conclusive. There seems to be mysteries here that even the ancient church does not fully untangle for us, but I am grateful for the ways in which they affirm the angels and delineate a proper understanding of them.Practically speaking, the presence of angels reminds us of the world beyond that which we apprehend with our senses. I think this a great book for sorting out what place angels should have in our theology.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book (via Book sneeze) in exchange for this review.",5.0,Help!

Incredibly, it is still just about the only device designed to surf the web on tv. The Revue allows me to go to sites I wouldn't go to with a pc for fear of spam, viruses, and malware. I go to sites that allow me to watch basically anything that's on any network as I got rid of cable over a year ago. I watched season 4 of Breaking Bad on one of these sites, and am now watching Boardwalk Empire. I also watch espn3 on it, and although the quality of the stream varies, it's usually better during the day, it's better than watching on a pc. It does get buggy sometimes, won't load video, shockwave flash crashes, says can't display content, etc. I then have to unplug it for a minute and it usually solves the problem. Tonight video wouldn't load for Mets-Yankees game, unplugged for a minute and it was fine thereafter. It even allows me to listen to grooveshark music, but not mog or rdio, which is strange.

Georgie (after his older brother's abdication many years later) is to become George VI, and Johnnie, afflicted with epilepsy, is shunted away from public view as well as the company of his family, where he grows up under the care of a devoted retinue, then dies at the age of 14.Poliakoff's scripting and direction make this story fragmented and starkly cool, representing life in the royal family's many residences as claustrophobic and its members as emotionally distant from each other. Georgie is the winning center of warmth and intelligence in the film, befriending a close aid of the king's (played wonderfully by Bill Nighy) and regarding his young brother with unwavering affection. Also at the center of the film is Johnnie's devoted caretaker (Gina McKee) who struggles unfailingly to find room for him in his parents' hearts.Meanwhile, events in Europe have their inevitable impact as both king and queen succumb to the dark forces that seem ready to sweep across war-time Britain. And their cousins, the Emperor of Russia and his family, are assassinated while Britain hesitates to offer them refuge from the Bolshevik Revolution.A powerful film, without many moments of emotional release.

A1R7CX1I1WYIKY,B000VSKAI8,Amazon Customer,"[9, 9]","After spending several hundred dollars at the chiropractor's office to relieve my pinched nerve and arthritic lower back I decided to look for an inversion table.  The overall reviews led me to picking this Ironman 4000 over the Teeter inversion models and I'm very happy I did.  The Teeter models have a problem with the ankle restraints being painful and requiring an additional purchase for relief.  I stepped right on this and had no ankle pain to deal with.FIRST THE NEGATIVES.1. This sucker is heavy.  Take a friend, a dolly, or expect to drag it (as I did) should you have to pick it up.2. One of the reviews warned about the foam material it is packed with.  It is very crumbly and will get all over if you don't contain it.  Most of this problem I eliminated by picking up all the pieces and putting them in trashbags before I began assembly.3. Once assembled, the table isn't something you could use and fold up for storage once or twice a day.  Make sure you have room for it.NOW THE POSITIVES.1. As intimidating as it looked to assemble everything went together perfectly.  There was no problem identifying parts or trying to line up holes to make it go together.  The tools provided were adequate but you probably have better tools of your own.2. This bench is extremely well constructed and designed.  In today's buyer beware world I believe I have spent money wisely and expect to use this the rest of my life.3. The Ironman 4000 is very heavy and stable.  I have no worries that anyone within the 300 pound, 6 foot 5 inch limits could use this and be safe.4. This isn't a miracle cure.  But if you want to stretch your spine, keep your flexibility, and even strengthen your abdominal muscles over a period of time, a few minutes a day on this machine should help your goals.This isn't a toy for your grandkids to do gymnastics on.

It was a sickening feeling that still churns my stomach. As the spanking was going on, I tried my hardest to not cry or scream or even whimper because I knew that I would get another set of beatings if I did this.

I have not yet been able to put my computer on it because my back is so sore after fighting with it all day.If you see a review that says this is ""easy"" to put together do NOT believe them!The nightmare assembly begins with none of the pieces being labelled.  That means you have to use trial an error to try to figure out what is what.  The only pieces that can be identified by logic are the small hanging shelf below the drawer, the table top, and the drawer side pieces.  Nothing else is clear until you play with it a few times.  it is not even clear which sides are the ""right"" verses ""wrong"" sides, let alone front from back and left from right.It was not until I was ready to put on the top metal bracket for the top shelf that I realized I had assembled parts of this backwards!Since the screws are not grouped and labelled, I managed to put the screws for the upper section into the drawer -- which was not obvious until I was ready for that section and my remaining screws would not fit.  Some of these parts are very similar in size so it is easy to confuse what is what, especially with the poor quality diagram on the ""instructions"" and micro type face used on the page.The only way I eventually assembled the desk was by coming back to Amazon and looking time and time again at the finished photo.  That is the ONLY way to really get it done.I should add that I am very good at furniture kits and have a lot of experience putting them together.  So it's pretty clear to me that the problem with assembly is really the lack of labeling and actual instructions.  In fact, you might do better to ditch the instructions and figure it out yourself; they are that useless.I am hoping once my computer is on the cart it will be a good piece of furniture.  Others think so and I bought this based on posted reviews.But ""easy"" to put together -- do not believe it!  this is the hardest kit I have ever attempted.  My entire body hurts from doing this.Also, because of the wierd ways the pieces go together, you cannot do this very well from a regular room or on the floor.  you need saw horses and other DYI tools and aids to help you balance clunky pieces.

A2MTUEA9UNCN50,1118608577,Alicia Webb,"[0, 0]","Chris Hadnagy's role as a distinguished figure in the Cybersecurity community is delightfully apparent in his authorship of ""Unmasking the Social Engineer"". In this second book on the art of social engineering (his topic of specialty), Hadnagy expertly analyzes Dr. Paul Ekman's lifelong work on body language. He deciphers and explains information about the various types on non-verbal communication while revealing relatable scenarios that are highly applicable to the social engineering element of cybersecurity.This book may trigger many 'ah ha' moments, especially if you are new to studying the art of body language. You will suddenly understand in far greater depth why people do the things they do with their body. You will also gain heightened awareness of how you control your own body, and how your body language might be perceived by others.As a cherry on top of it all, the book even contains a medley of helpful, illustrative photographs to help visually relay concepts in the study of body language.Similar to the concept of ethical hacking, one must learn to think like a hacker (or social engineer in this case) in order to most effectively defend against a social engineer. For example, in Chapter 7- The Human Emotional Processor, Hadnagy discusses the importance of building empathy or sadness during the process of an Amygdala hijack. He gives details of what a person might do or say in order to gain that empathy. After reading these details and letting it all sink in, the reader somehow instantly become a little less vulnerable to this sort of attack. This book is a solid proof that knowledge is power, especially in the study of nonverbal communication.I have had the personal pleasure of interviewing Chris Hadnagy two times in the past two years and have gained a world of insight into the art of social engineering by doing so.

AODKUG6FAKD2Z,1564784363,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 6]","In 'Knowledge of Hell', a narrator who shares the name and biography of author Ant&oacute;nio Lobo Antunes leaves the vacation town of Quinta da Balaia and drives through the Portuguese countryside toward Lisbon, to return to his duties as a psychiatrist at Miguel Bombarda mental hospital.  Along the way, the author strives to peel away the faade of his character, to report his scattered thoughts, memories, fantasies and fears concerning his work, while describing the surrounding countryside in terms both nightmarish and threatening.  Though this character, like Antunes, was also involved in the cruel Portuguese Colonial War in Angola, and knew up-close the barbaric realities of conflict, it wasn't until his tenure began at Miguel Bombarda that he truly gained a knowledge of Hell.This was my first experience with Antunes' work, and, stylistically, it is the most difficult prose I've ever read.  Here the author switches points of view abruptly - sometimes mid-sentence - and inserts dreams and fantasies into the narrative without alerting the reader in any way.  He projects his paranoia and insecurities onto partial memories, desires, and absurd imaginary confrontations.  Sometimes he records dream-like episodes, where he is suddenly mistaken for a patient and locked away in the asylum, or he inhabits the unknowable final conversations of a suicide, but presents them all in the same unreal tempo as those thoughts that I had credited as rational.  To further complicate, he piles simile on top of simile, modifying one with another, and perhaps even another, as the sentence winds through clause after clause until I'm forced to go back and hunt for the original subject.  In the end, it is a non-linear phantasmagoria where Angola, the hospital, and Portugal, as represented by its countryside and history, all collapse into the refractory, unreliable mental process of this doctor and splatter across the page with abandon.It took more than a chapter to even accustom myself to the rhythms of Antunes' words, and even though I was eventually able to penetrate the style for its content, I would never say that the book flowed or became easier to comprehend.  It did remain consistent to itself though, but only by maintaining an aggressive concentration was I able to see the book through.  After finishing, I went back over the first chapter, and was quite surprised to see just how much more I was able to glean from it; so there is no doubt that, for me, should I ever decide to re-read the book, that I'll pick up a substantial amount of new information.But it does not take a great deal of discernment to understand that Antunes is condemning the field of psychiatry here - that, literally, the inmates are running the asylum, that psychiatry is nothing more than an advanced form of charlatanism, and that the system of the institution is ineffective, cruel, and broken.  It is the weight of the inhumanity that Antunes' alter ego in the book has experienced in that institution that has nearly fractured his own mental processes, and thus sparked a vacation, a sabbatical away from the hospital to which he is in the process of returning.So what is it exactly that Antunes is trying to accomplish with his complicated prose if his objectives are this straightforward? (As an aside, I will freely admit the possibility that there are uncounted concealed insights that I was unable to pick up on.  Yet I can't help feeling that any insights I may have missed circle back to the original proposition that no one is crazier than anyone else, no matter what their exterior behavior indicates, and that modern attempts to deal with mental illness is even more barbaric than warfare.)  About mid-way through the book, it dawned on me that if anyone were able to fully and thoroughly document the mental processes and thoughts going on in my own head at any given time, the result would also look like a tangled, incoherent mess.  Like Antunes' habit of skipping helter-skelter from subject to memory to observation to fantasy, my own thoughts often follow similar, incomprehensible patterns, even including the disassociation technique of thinking of myself in the third-person.  Of course, since I'm comfortable there, my craziness seems normal, though to anyone else it would sound certifiable.And that may be the point Antunes' is most eager to elicit with his oblique styling.  Yet since other reviewers and editorials concerning his work indicate that his technique is consistent throughout his oeuvre, then I must assume that, rather than a limited objective meant to merely enhance the points of this particular book, his methods are an exhaustive and detailed attempt to honestly describe the reality of our mental world by portraying it as it actually functions.  Thus, the difference between Antunes (at least here in 'Knowledge of Hell') and those writers trying to reveal the subconscious or detailing hallucinogenic states or even those writers like Faulkner, whose dense dreamy prose seems designed to awaken us to an idea, is that Antunes is a writer concerned with realism - with an absolute commitment to faithfully reproduce his character's interior dialogue.  His technique then is a way to illuminate that reality, like a cubist painter who tries to reveal three dimensions on a flat canvas.  To someone with little patience for such things, neither attempt is going to come off very well.After absorbing the novelty of this idea, I have to admit that I slowly began losing the edge of my interest.  Rooting around in the muck of anyone's consciousness is bound to be distasteful at best, though 'Knowledge of Hell' does not fully plumb the depths of sordidness that I often suspected it was leading me toward.  Still, it is called 'Knowledge of Hell' for a reason, and though I think Antunes legitimately discussed unpalatable subjects without exploiting them purely for emotional response, this is not a book for the squeamish.'Knowledge of Hell' was originally published in 1980, one year after the book ""The Land at the End of the World', and, by inference, might be considered as sort of a sequel - or at least a continuation of the story that began in Angola and then picks up in the Miguel Bombarda hospital.  I do still plan on reading 'The Land at the End of the World' at some time - perhaps that is indicative of the value I found in 'Knowledge of Hell' - but my enthusiasm is tempered by the emotional drag of this first acquaintance.  The overall effect is one of a severely subjective appraisal of the world in which ignorance is truly bliss, and once those who are discerning enough pierce the veil of our mutually agreed upon reality, there is little beyond it but despair and loneliness.On a lighter note, I found this Dalkey Archive Press edition first-rate and solid, and the partial listing of their catalog full of fascinating unknowns (to me).  Based on their recognition and inclusion of Antonio Lobo Antunes in their stable of writers, and the quality of their books, this looks as if their list might be worth investigating regardless of what I know about the individual authors, much the same way I'll often take a flyer on unknown authors from the NYRB imprint.

Here are some added reasons why:Some of the mothership and fighter effects are adequate to good.  Most are poor.  The beam weapons are, IMHO, very poor.  The Sheriff's step van crash was such a poor effect, they had to edit out most of it and make the footage just the briefest glimpse.Like many not so good films, much of it is depicted at night allowing the old crutch; poor to no lighting.  Frequently almost a totally dark screen.  Many or most times, it appears the audience is expected to just use their imagination since not enough light is present to see who is who, details, actions, etc.Additionally, the background music is extremely tedious.  One plus regarding sound:  At least the film maker didn't choose to try to ""enhance"" this poor film with deafening, ear bleeding sound effects.  Likewise, the director did NOT resort to having the cameraman shake the camera to add fake action to a dying film.  I kept expecting it somehow.Probably not what they intended, but the actors and actresses are frequently directed to give a ridiculous slack jawed look of surprise.  These phony expressions are so far gone, they are actually funny.Strong suggestion:  Don't pay any added money to rent or buy the movie download or the DVD.

A1HMV248RPGTIM,0393341372,LEON L CZIKOWSKY,"[3, 3]","The author seeks hope for people with severe mental illnesses and their families.  He is troubled that the deinstitutionalization of people with such illnesses such as severe schizophrenia has led to much violence.  He has found over 3,000 cases where a person with paranoid schizophrenia has committed murder.People became aware of deplorable conditions in mental hospitals with particular intensity in the 1940s and following decades.  This led to patients being removed from mental hospitals. In 1955, there were 558,000 in public mental hospitals (when the national population was 164 million).  In 2006, there were 40,000 in public mental hospitals (with a national population of 300 million).  Many of those who were deinstitutionalized found themselves as victims of violence, were incarcerated, and/or became homeless.The legal movement to close or reduce mental hospitals argued that involuntary hospitalizations were contrary to our belief in freedom.The National Mental Health Information Center estimates there are 12.8 million adult (or 5.4% of adults) with a serious mental illness. 4.7 million receive social security for their non-retardation disorder.  It is within this group that exists a subset that creates most of the problems.  England estimates that 10% of its schizophrenics created 80% of totally costs associated with schizophrenia.The author estimates there are 500,000 ""problematic"" and 50,000 ""most dangerous"" people with severe mental problems.  They live primarily in urban areas.  The crimes that often shock the public the most are often committed by people in this group.The author notes the question facing us is whether or not crazy people ""have a right to be crazy"".Guidelines state a person cannot be hospitalized against the person's will until they are a threat to themselves or to someone else.  Many families live in fear of a threatening relative, often claiming voices or God is commanding them to commit violent acts.  Yet until a violent act is attempted or occurs, outside help is not available.  Unfortunately, many people have been murdered or harmed before the help is provided.  Conversely, people whose illnesses caused them to threaten others have been killed or injured by those they threatened.In the 1950s, some conservative political groups believed that mental health treatment was part of Communist-Soviet attempts to control the minds of Americans.  Minute Women, U.S.A, compared mental health hospitalizations to the Soviet concentration camps.  The Daughters of American Revolution noted that 80% of U.S. psychologists were from foreign countries, with many of them from the Soviet Union.  Fiscal conservatives wanted to reduce mental health spending.Medicaid and Medicare passed in 1965, providing for benefits for people with mental disabilities.  State governments switched patients from state supported mental hospitals to community settings where the Federal government would pay for the costs of care through Medicaid and Medicare.Liberals criticized the warehousing of people with mental disabilities in psychiatric hospitals where they were provided with inadequate care.California responded by passing the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act that diminished mental health treatment in 1969.  The bill passed the legislature unanimously.  Supporters of the legislation believed the patients with psychiatric difficulties were able to make their own decisions as to what treatment they wanted.  It was argued that people with mental health disabilities had lower rates of violent acts than did the general population.  It was not noted that the reason for this lower rate was because many were in institutions where they could not commit violent public acts.Once California closed psychiatric hospitals, it then faced the problem that it lacked facilities to treat people who sought treatment or met the legal requirements for involuntary treatment.In 1973, California began closing many psychiatric hospitals.  Governor Ronald Reagan were not impressed that 71% of psychiatrists voted Democratic nor that several psychiatrists had stated that Reagan ally Barry Goldwater was not sane.California had 37,000 psychiatric patients institutionalized in the mid-1950s.  The deinstitutionalization of patients began under Governor Goodwin Knight, a Republican, and continued under successive Governors Edmund Brown, a Democrat, and Reagan, a Republican.  By 1973, there were under 7,000 people institutionalized as psychiatric patients during Reagan's tenure.The number of patient s involuntarily institutionalized by court order decreased by 99% in California from 1969 to 1978.  The average days of hospitalization for those who were involuntarily committed fell from 180 days to 15 days.Many of those discharged from psychiatric care became homeless.  Many lived in boarding houses in condition worse than they had when institutionalized.  Three studies concluded those discharged lived in ghetto conditions.  Many had not access to psychiatric treatment.  Many eventually entered the criminal justice system.A 1971 study of the Los Angeles homeless estimated that 30% to 50% had serious mental illness.  They were often victimized with beatings, getting robbed, and being raped.  Later studies confirmed similar results, with one study finding 79% of the homeless surveyed had at some point been in a psychiatric hospital and 74% had been arrested.  This study also found 30% were found to be ""too paranoid"" to accept psychiatric help.Psychiatric services in San Francisco County increased 99% between 1980 and 1993.  Sacramento County jails reported having, in 1995, 28% of its inmates requiring psychiatric medication.  The author notes that prisons had become the largest mental health institutions.Prison presents problems for mentally ill prisoners.  Violent inmates are sometimes put off by the behavior of the mentally ill and inmates then attack the mentally ill.No Federal or state government is producing data on the number of violent crimes committed by those with severe mental illness.  It is known there are many instances where this happens.  It is also observed that an increase in managed care and outpatient services seems to lower these rates.In 1955, California had 37,500 state hospital beds, or 1 for every 352 of the state's 13.2 million.  In 2003, there were 4,275 such beds, or 1 for every 8,304 of the state's 35.5 million.A 2008 San Diego study found that homelessness was the reality for 20% of patients treated for schizophrenia and for 17% of patients treated for bipolar disorder.A 1999 California study found 20% of state prisoners and 11% of county inmates were severely mentally ill.Every California county has more people with severe mental illness in prison than in a hospital.The cost of California prison psychiatric treatments was $21 million in 1993 and $245 million in 2003.Some opinions have changed over time.  Frank Lanterman, the legislator who sponsored the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, argues the Act needs to be changed.  Ironically, a day before holding  a hearing on allowing court ordered outpatient treatment for dangerous people who refuse to take the medicine for their disorders, a psychotic person drove his 18 wheel tractor into the side of the California Capitol building.  The proposal passed and became law.Fiscal conservatives fought a movement towards providing more psychiatric services. The costs, in Los Angeles in 2004, for one day of psychiatric hospital care was $607, for prison was $85, for jail was $64, and for a public shelter was $3.  The author notes this failed to consider cost of the numerous criminal justices arrests of people with psychiatric problems.It is estimated that people with severe mental illness committed at least 4,700 homicides between 1970 and 2004 in California.In 1972, a three judge panel in the Lessard Decision created specific criteria that made it more difficult to involuntarily treat someone for a mental illness. This overturned 700 years of civil law going back to England that a government is responsible for protecting people who can't protect themselves.There is a risk that government may have civil suits for failing to provide proper mental illness care.  A Federal judge awarded $5.4 million in such a suit in 1999.Dane County Wisconsin has a team of 5 to 15 mental health professionals who take round the clock responsibility for mental health patients.  They provide care including medication maintenance, housing, job training, and rehabilitation.It was found in a study that 57% of schizophrenic patients studied were not aware they had schizophrenia to a ""moderate to severe"" degree.  In these cases, the brain often has anosognosia, which means the person in unable to recognize it has a disorder.  With Alzheimer's patients, anosognosia is a permanent condition.  Anosognosia in schizophrenics exists in the frontal lobes, the parietal lobes, and connections between these two lobes.  Anosognosia thus affects multiple brain areas.  Anosognosia is the primary reason why someone with mental illness does not take their medication for their mental illness.  When the law requires a person to request treatment in order to receive treatment, a person with anosognosia will not be treated.  Sadly, anosognosia is linked to increased violent behavior.After the Lesard decision, every state by 1980 had adopted laws restricting the involuntary institutionalization of the mentally ill.A New York study found that mentally ill homeless who were supposed to be but were not taking their medications were 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 27 times more likely to commit a non-violent crime than were mentally ill people requiring medication who were in stable housing environments.Studies indicate that at least 5% to 10% of people with severe psychiatric illness will engage in at least one serious act of violence per year.It is conservatively estimated that people with severe mental illness commit at least 5% of murders.  About 50% to 60% of murders committed by a mentally ill person are of a family members.  By contrast, a family member is killed in 16% of murders committed by someone without a mental illness.The violent behavior of a minority of people with mental illness has created a stigma for all people with mental illness.People with epilepsy are required to make medication before operating vehicles.  The author notes further laws requiring the taking of medication by people with additional mental health issues may be required.A New York study found that 40%of mentally ill patients discharged from hospitalization are re-hospitalized within six months. An Illinois study found 30% of mental health patients discharged are re-hospitalized within one month.A study showed that mental illness patients who likely were taking their medication were 3% more violent than others in a 10 week period compared to those who were not likely taking their medication who were 14% more likely to commit violence.  This study concluded that mentally ill people were not significantly more likely to commit violence than their neighbors.  The author notes those with a anosgosia were not included in this study, which skewed the sample. This study also compared rates of crime within the high crime rate neighborhoods were mentally ill people tend to live.The author supports a law that broadens the scope of requiring involuntarily treatment.  Assisted Outpatient Treatments laws have passed several states to allow for the involuntary treatment of seriously mentally ill people who pose a danger.  These treatments are given to people with past experiences with violence, are substance abusers, have anosognosia, are refusing to properly take their medications, are displaying antisocial behaviors, and have a neurological impairment.  It is noted that 85% to 90% of people in this category are male.A hospital uses criteria to know when to have extra security on hand.  Using similar criteria as descried previously reduced violent acts in one hospital study by 92%.The author recommends developing a data base of high risk people by judicial order.  This would be available only to law enforcement officers, authorized mental health personnel, and to a limited degree to firearm dealers who would not be allowed to sell a firearm to a name that checks against this list.There are numerous ways to move people towards treatment.  Those charged with misdemeanors could be provided the option of taking their medications versus imprisonment. The author also mentions that government benefits could be withdrawn to those not taking their medication.State governments are urged to collect more data.

Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor.Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other.Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before. He brings tragedy to life through the eyes of innocent children. Readers of all ages will be spellbound until the last page and beyond.Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka ""Readingjunky""",5.0,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,1163721600.0,"11 17, 2006"

To my utter happiness a fantastic character showed up--Lieutenant Jack Daniels--and I just couldn't stop reading.  Thank god it was only a novella.The serial killers--yes, there are two, and it's kinda like a first date of sorts--were sick as hell, yet unnervingly interesting.  And I was horrified to find my new favorite female police officer at their tender mercies...but I was suddenly ravenous to find out how she out-witted and dispatched these two sicko's.I can't say I want to read anymore about the two serial killers, though I read there are more stories about them, but I am definitely going to pick up another Jack Daniels novel to get lost in.",5.0,"A very, very good read.",1334275200.0,"04 13, 2012"

I'm a dedicated air gunner and have either tried most other A/G pistols or owned them, I'm a older guy. Only the Crosman 1377c pneumatic in .177 (now also in.22) which I also own, can compare for value or ownership. I have a ""Patio Range"" and shoot at 10m from a bench rest with sand bags with accuracy my priority, the 2240 delivers for me quarter size groups with a BSA red/dot shooting Crosman H/P's,7.9 gr. I'm satisfied with that,and I can get them at Walmart cheap. a scope would tighten up the group. I also get 50+ shots per cylinder. The one downside to this pistol is that its slow, no action shooting here. I've modified mine with a Crosman steel breech and Crosman cut down 12"" barrel, the after market accessories seem to be endless for this gun. The stock rear sight is funky but works just fine in standard trim. I even like the grips, these guns are very easy pistols to work on, think kitchen table. The Co2 starts losing power below 60 dg F, so its a warm weather gun. My gun holds Co2 very well, (months) I really have no complaints, be sure you add a drop of pellgun oil to the tip of the Co2 cylinder and the 2240 will last a very long time, mine is 7 yrs. old and still going strong. Every part has a number and stock parts are dirt cheap if ever needed. I'll probably buy another one and leave it stock so I can use a holster for my woods ""walk around"" gun. My gun hits very hard, it will blow thru starlings at my bird feeder range (30') and its not to noisy, it saves money from traveling to and from firearm ranges. I find the cost of shooting this pistol about the same as a .22 rim-fire (bulk) when everything is considered, pellets & Co2. My home range has much better amenities than ANY firearm range, and I get to shoot in my own back yard, whats not to like?.  this pistol is made in the USA, and I highly recommend it.

They made the effect supplement to the activities I designed for each brain rule.I appreciate that the author only includes solid, and repeated, research in his book.

They actually has just received them in my area, and IMMEDIATELY discounted the base unit and ALL THE ATTACHMENTS. So naturally I picked it up. Just to be clear, I own a mainly Dewalt power tools. I already have a Dewalt 18v XRP hammer drill, two Dewalt 18v XRP drills, a Dewalt 18V flashlight, a Dewalt 18v XRP impact driver, as well as a Dewalt 10 amp corded drill, a Dewalt corded random orbital sander, and a Dewalt corded circular saw, a Dremel SawMax, a Dewalt corded jigsaw, a Sonicrafter oscillating tool, an MK Diamond 5&#34; handheld tile saw, not to mention an 11 amp and a 12 amp Milwaukee Sawzall. So I don't NEED another drill, or impact driver. But the novelty of the interchangeable heads appealed to me.SO... I picked up the base unit, and the attachments the big box Home something store was selling *the impact driver, detail sander, trim saw, jigsaw, and the oscillating tool attachment. I then headed over to the other big box store and picked up the router attachment, and the 20v Li-Ion leaf blower/weed whacker combo set on sale, it comes with a quick charger better than the one with the base Matrix, and TWO more batteries for the price of TWO BATTERIES! Essentially the blower and weed whacker and charger were free. THEN I headed over to Sears, where they sell the competitive Bolt-On version. The clerk told me it wasn't compatible, but I came prepared with the impact driver and a charged battery. I popped the battery in their display model, and the impact driver head on and voila! It worked just peachy. The Craftsman version had a hammer drill attachment and an air inflation tool, so naturally I picked those up as well as their bag. Then I went back and grabbed the reciprocating saw attachment when it came out.Bottom line... Do I NEED these tools? No. I have every one of them in another form. But I like having a cordless interchangeable option. My Dewalt 18V impact driver blows this Matrix 20V Lithuim Ion out of the water. But for 95% of what it gets used for it's fine. I even reach for it more often now. These tools aren't perfect. They are, however, a hell of a lot cheaper than buying each of these tools as a stand alone version from one of the higher end manufacturers like Dewalt, Bosch, Milwaukee, or Makita.So if you're just doing so home improvement projects here and there I would definitely say get these.

While they do like board games, we actually rarely finish one because they move onto something else or just want to move around.  Elefun Snackin' Safari is a super fun game to get kids moving.  It is a game for kids ages 3 and up, and I genuinely feel a 3 year  old could play it and understand it.  All you have to do is snap down your elephant trunk and have it suction-cup to a card.  We had no problems with the cards sticking and my boys had a blast.  The length was perfect and they were able to comfortably hold the elephant in their hands, as was I.  The game is for two players only, which may be a drawback if you have more than two kids, but it goes pretty quick as there are only 13 snack cards to snack up!

The belt is made of sturdy sections of leather held together by two tiny, thin and weak connectors.

I repaired it with leather adhesive under the connectors, and reinforced the other connectors with the adhesive as well.  However, most people don't have a home workshop like mine that would have things like that available.

A2Q6C03WBWO14G,0898756138,Beck,"[14, 17]","I could choose from a few different angles to take with my review. I could just write about my own personal opinion about the book, and tell you to take that at face value, or I could write to convince you why my opinion is justified, in the hopes of saving you money from buying this book. Kim Jong-Il, however, has already done much of the work for me, when he wrote his preface to the book (find it in the product description). I'll repeat it here, as I think it offers more than enough insight to what the book is like:""The cinema is now one of the main objects on which efforts should be concentrated in order to conduct the revolution in art and literature. The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.""Allow me to break this down sentence by sentence. His first statement is rather bold (regarding cinema as a forefront of art and literature), yet he offers nothing to back up this claim (I know, it's just the preface, but you wont find any justifications in the book either.). Moreover, why would such a revolution be necessary, wanted, or even interesting to read for that matter? As has been previously noted, repetition can be found throughout (e.g. the preface's first 2 sentences: ""The cinema... art and literature."", ""the cinema"" and ""revolution"" are repeated 3 times in 4 sentences, ""art and literature"" repeated 4 times, twice in the last sentence.). All 4 sentences of this preface say roughly the same thing: Cinema, being an important part in art and literature, can be a useful tool in revolutionizing the whole. I hope that's enough.I can imagine only one reason to read this book: to see (if only a minor amount) into the mind of a person in a position of great influence. Let me say, it is my own opinion, that you'll get the jist of the book just from reading the preface a couple times.",1.0,As good of an author as he is a leader.,1282089600.0,"08 18, 2010"

On the island, you don't have to worry about the neighbors' dogs chasing you, or that shady looking guy standing up on the next corner. You don't have to worry if it's late at night, or early morning. You don't have to worry about it raining or storming on you, or dying of a heat stroke in the sun either!! =]I like the trainers; they encourage me to keep playing every day; I like to hear what kinds of things they come up with to say. I mainly use Warren as my Trainer. He flirts with me, and that amuses me, LOL!!You can use the Wii remote and nunchuck, the Wii balance board, or the DDR mat with this game. I use the Wii Balance Board. You step to the beat of the songs. Everytime you hit the beat, you get points; use those points to buy trees, buildings, new songs, open up new routes, and more! (when you use the nunchuck & remote, you put the nunchuck in your pocket like a pedometer).You can change the difficulty level to make it easier, which I reccommend for beginners.You can add things to your queue (the 3 cirlcles at the top, middle of the screen), and then when you have enough points, you get the item. For example, let's say you want to buy a tree for 50 points, but you only have 10 points. You click on the capsule anyway, and it adds it to your queue. Once you get 50 points, the item automatically is purchased. But now, you have to walk back and find the capsule again, and this time it will be glowing, so you'll know that you've already bought it. Click it, and VOILA - there's your tree!CONS:I don't care much for the mini games included, but I haven't really given them much of a chance.Some of the songs are crap, but there are enough songs that I like to keep me satisfied.You walk past the same character over and over again throughout the game.

And they really do rock the house here.  Listen to Dennis ""The Little Drummer Boy"" Diken ""bash away, bash away all"" during the intro to the Smithereens' own version of ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" while Jim Babjak's electric guitar decks the halls with reens riffs, Severo's bass pumps along at full ""thrilla throttle"" and Pat DiNizio croons in maximum rock `n' carolling mode.  This is obviously not your average piped-in holiday music at the mall snoozefest.There is much to enjoy on this Christmas album beginning with its majestic opener ""Waking Up On Christmas Morning"" written by lead guitarist Jim Babjak.  It is one of three Smithereens originals on this CD that also includes ""Christmas (I Remember)"" and a rerecording of their song ""All Revved Up"" that's been re-revved up and revamped as ""Christmas Time All Over The World"".  The Smithereens also add their own holiday dressing to some Christmas classics and semi-rare covers.  Pat contributes some exuberant harmonica playing to Elvis' ""Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)"" while the guitars chug along like a runaway ""Polar Express"" train.  The Smithereens also surf the yule tide with an excellent cover of the Beach Boys' ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" and do a really rollicking version of Chuck Berry's ""Run Rudolph Run"".  The album later takes a side trip to Who-ville when Jim Babjak sings ""Christmas"" from the Who's ""Tommy"" album ""and you know that can't be bad"" when the Smithereens joyously revisit fab four territory with the Beatles' ""Christmas Time Is Here Again"".  They even salute the Ramones with a catchy punk vs. Motown re-arrangement of their holiday song ""Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)"".  The band also rocks in the New Year with their Christmas carolers on steroids version of ""Auld Lang Syne"".""Christmas with the Smithereens"" delivers a much needed kick in the Christmas balls to an often tired and tiresome holiday music industry.  It's the perfect antidote to overly treacly Christmas ""pap music"" and sugar shock inducing holiday elevator music.

PRISCO,"[0, 1]","It's nice to see Peter Banks getting some recognition now, which about as well-deserved as the lack of it he had previously.A big part of the this album's appeal rests with the staggeringly star-studded support, though  it is somewhat thinly spread: John Wetton, for example, is credited only for one short track mid-album. Phil Collins has never been particularly outstanding as a drummer. Steve Hackett plays through most of this, making this something of a Yes-meets-Genesis album. Like both those bands, there's a rather labored quality to the compositions (which form what was side 1 of the LP).In contrast, there's an agreeably informal quality to the concluding jams that feature fellow guitarist Jan Akkerman, with whom Peter enjoys energetic repartee. These were previously side two of the LP -- arguably worth the price in themselves, for fans of long, spontaneous jamming between kings.Consequently, we find an album possessed of interesting aspects, not too heavily weighted toward friendly improvisation nor strict composition: songs and probing jams in equal measure, truly ""two sides"" of Peter Banks.

Rather than portraying the Philippines as the proud emerging market that it has become and the role that the US has played in that remarkable story, the author states that the Filipino people are largely dishonest and that an entire generation of women between the ages of 18 to 24 are prostitutes.There can simply be no excuse for such writings. Thousands of the women who he wrongfully claims are working on their backs are actually working in call centers throughout the country.  The Philippines is the number one outsourcing destination in the world and it has surpassed India as the number one location for call center work.

Koenigsberg,"[6, 8]","Funny how tastes differ.I do love everything by Xenakis, but .... when I listen to this CD, ""Kassandra"" is my favorite.Sometimes I even find myself skipping through the other pieces, and only listening to ""Kassandra"" in its entirety.But ""Kassandra"" never fails, to thrill and chill me. It is one of my most favorite of Xenakis' pieces (and I'm a big fan, I've heard a lot of his music, either live or on CD's, and I was privileged to meet him a few times, etc.).I only give this CD 4 out of 5 stars, only because I am way more fond of ""Kassandra"" than I am of the rest of it.... and the live ambient (analog) recording, though not bad, is not the absolute best audio quality I could imagine; though that is partially due to the ridiculously extreme dynamic range that had to be captured, in the performance of the pieces, from the loud loud percussion down to much quieter sounds.I would say that ""Kassandra"" is one of my favorite Xenakis pieces (and being a big Xenakis fan, that is saying a lot), but the instrumentals on the rest of the CD sometimes grow tiresome to me (it's still Xenakis, so it's still great, just not among my favorite pieces of his).If you do love the extended vocal style of ""Cassandra"" as I do (a deep male baritone voice, often desperate, often wildly gyrating between deep tones and shrieking falsetto), you will also probably like Xenakis' piece ""Ais"", also for a male voice, which has been recorded several times on some of his other CD's. I think ""Ais"", like ""Cassandra"", is also another addition to his Oresteia family of pieces? (also the voice in ""Ais"" is amplified unlike that in ""Kassandra"", and I think ""Ais"" is for a tenor, rather than baritone?)someday I'd love to hear a new performance, of a most ""complete"" Oresteia, with ""Kassandra"", ""Ais"", and any other newer additions he made to the original suite?And yet another vocal piece of his that I really love, in addition to ""Kassandra"" and ""Ais"", is one called ""N'Shima"" (for ""amplified peasant voices""), also recorded more than once I think.plus to round out the mentioning of Xenakis' vocal pieces, there are a couple more choral works, on a CD shared with some of Messiaen's choral pieces.",4.0,"actually I prefer ""Kassandra""",1134432000.0,"12 13, 2005"

If you are equally tired of listening to tenured publicly overpaid diversity professors  drone on about the percecution / profiling of muslim men, also sick of socio-communist ""journalists"" living, writing, and enriching themselves in the land of the free, only to deride Uncle Sam every chance they get. Then buy this book, unlike much of what the leftist media write about, Goldberg's essays are filled with truth and fact instead of the outright lies and imaginary conservative demons liberals seem to be so fond of taking pen to. Thank You Mr. Goldberg.... p.s. One problem, by making him number 37, you have assigned way to much importance to Al Franken's role in the current media shootout, Mr. Franken has lent just about about the same amount of talent to the liberal media's cause as he did to SNL way back when real comedy writers like Dan Akyroyd, Michael O'Donahue and Gilda Radner had us rolling on the floor in convulsions. Franken was and is still, only riding the coat tails of people largely more talented than himself. You got your 15 minutes Al, its time to cut your losses, call it a day and give someone with real talent a chance at some air time....",5.0,Goldberg's Golden Hammer,1123891200.0,"08 13, 2005"

These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories.",4.0,"Only one star taken off for not putting the word ""snack"" on the packaging and the clusters being too small.",1243555200.0,"05 29, 2009"

A1L20MX19ZMNW5,B0014CSNDY,paisleymonsoon,"[2, 2]","The creators of this CD really got it right. Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable. I'll definitely prefer it to following instructions from a book.",5.0,Tastefully Done,1210809600.0,"05 15, 2008"

So make sure you have an entire evening dedicated to reading if you pick up this book because you won't want to put it down!My Opinion:I want to start off by saying that out of all paranormal creatures zombies rank lowest on my list of favorites. I have tried repeatedly to read various zombie themed books and one after another they made it to my CNF list. (Could Not Finish) I gave After Life Lessons a chance because I am smitten with both of the authors and everything I've read from both has yet to disappoint me. That being said, After Life Lessons was the first zombie book that I actually was able to finish reading and enjoyed!I truly wasn't expecting this book to floor me like it did! This book changed my perception of the zombie genre all together. This book has a new take on the classic Zombie Apocalypse, one I find to be far more realistic to how people would respond during a zombie out-break. Most representations are filled with too much drama, cruelness, and far-out crazy antics that make the overall story hard to relate to. I find that the way the characters react in this book represents how people would really handle this type of disaster. They show the true gritty emotions; fear, love, courage, regret, and compassion. This book also has a perfect balance of zombie scenes placed throughout it. It's about so much more than just zombies, trust me.Emily and Aaron are a definite power-couple. They are like day and night, but they fit together great. Opposites really do attract, I suppose. They have so many obstacles to face but always make it through them because they have each other. They understand each other in such a profound way, if only everyone could have a chance to be in a relationship like theirs. It goes both ways, when it's going bad.. It's really damn horrible but when it's going good... It's just amazing! As a warning, when these two are alone things tend to get steamy, so make sure to keep a fan near to help with the spike in temperature.After Life Lessons put my emotions one hell of a ride that I'm not sure I'll ever recover from. It drained me physically and mentally, but I consider that to be a good thing. Any book that can have that much of an impact on me has to be special. This book has everything you could ever want in a novel... action, humor, romance, and sex. I could barely stumble out of my bed after one particular scene... oh the shock and horror I experienced. I can't share details of that scene here because it would spoil the plot. So if you're curious you will just have to read this fantastic book for yourself.

A15JJFM0OHA05Z,0140267581,Matt Burrows,"[1, 1]","Those who know and value the John Hawkes of old (Second Skin, Travesty, Blood Oranges) may be disappointed with Irish Eye. Hawkes, who once said, ""The true enemies of the novel are plot, characters, and setting,"" has forsaken his prior belief with the publishing of Irish Eye. The book itself is a mildy interesting text best representative of a nightmarish fairytale, as it surrounds readers with a unique view of Ireland and tracks the journey to maturity of young Dervla as she strives to find love and her place in the world. Along the way Hawkes treats readers to various interesting characters, of which Teddy seems the only character to represent the Hawkes of old--tortured, confined, and just angry at the world he refuses to give in and comprise. And so Dervla, our wide-eyed and innocent narrator, follows him all the way. Though some may claim Irish Eye to be a nice introduction to John Hawkes, don't let this fool you...these comments are made simply because this book is ""easier"" to read. Yes, some of Hawkes major themes are present (disorder and obscurity), but the constriction of characters and reactions/truths that arise from this are largely absent. If you're looking for an actual quality introduction to John Hawkes I would suggest Travesty or possibly Second Skin (with Second Skin being the more difficult read of the two). Overall, a major joy of Hawkes is deciphering that which he writes in order to truly understand the human condition and his fragmented, often disorganized novels challenge readers to not only reread numerous passages but ultimately come to their own conclusion of what the text tells them about life. And with this focus in mind, Irish Eye ultimately comes up short. All authors have a glitch in their library of writings and this seems to be Hawkes. An interesting read--yes.

When you have no expectations, you can never be disappointed.  So I was pleasantly surprised that MLB 2K12 has turned out to be a pretty decent game-pad baseball game.  Perhaps I'm just lucky but on my Dell Inspiron notebook it runs very smoothly with no problems at all.  Game play is very good but a lot of what you experience depends on what roster you're using and your tune file settings.I would suggest to anyone who wants a better MLB 2K12 to visit mvpmods.com  No I'm not spamming for them but they have dedicated people over there who mod baseball games to make them look and play better.  What they offer for this particular game is better than anything 2K Sports can supply.  This review is based on what I've downloaded from that site regarding roster files and difficulty tunes.Playing individual games in the Franchise Mode feature I've had many great battles, close games, blow outs.........pretty much what you would expect playing major league baseball.  Some starters go deep in the game (well over 100 pitches), extra inning nail biters, just about everything really.  Using an XBox controller for the PC seems to be the best option for this game, you don't have to re-map your button controls and you have full control over everything using this.  I would recommend this pad for this particular game if you don't already have one.I took a star off the ratings because like others have said, getting online to play someone is damned near impossible.  The new feature of this game, the MLB ""Living Season"" is also pretty much broken but like I said above, the Franchise Mode works just fine (as does one off exhibition games if that's all you want to do).  One thing though, baseball games like this will never ever replace a good sim like OOTP if you're looking for that sort of statistical gameplay only.So in closing, if you're XBox or PS3 free like I am and want to continue the tradition of PC baseball, this game is it.  Modify it the right way and you've got a pretty decent game-pad based baseball gaming experience.",4.0,Pretty good gamepad baseball,1335916800.0,"05 2, 2012"

A33DF1KSNX4SHK,1420106805,Angela Korra'ti,"[0, 1]","Scoundrel, Book 2 of Zoe Archer's Blades of the Rose series, came across my radar with a bang thanks to the Smart Bitches Trashy Books ladies and their current montly book club. As I mentioned in my review of Book 1, Warrior, I was very happy to see a cover with a hero who's not only fully dressed, but who also seemed to come right out of a mold I find most swoonable indeed: the Indiana Jones archetype, ready for adventure.Even more so that with Book 1, Scoundrel delivered this in spades. I enjoyed Scoundrel quite a bit more, in no small part due to the hero. Bennett Day of the Blades of the Rose is an unhesitant rake, cheerfully cutting a swath through the dozens of women willing to go at it with him in the sheets in between his far more serious missions for his compatriots, and sometimes both at once. Little does he know he's about to meet up with London Harcourt, the daughter of an Heir of Albion--and whose husband Bennett in fact once killed. London has no idea whatsoever of the nefarious activities of her father and spouse, and suffice to say, her worldview is blown wide open when she finds out that her father has hauled her off to Greece to make use of her gift with ancient languages. Harcourt's bent on tracking down the same Source Bennett's pursuing, and Bennett and his fellow Blades have no choice but to abduct London, clue her in, and hope like hell that she'll defect to their team and help them.A couple of things kicked Scoundrel up another notch over Book 1 for me. One is the secondary romance playing out between the witch Athena and the boat captain Kallas, which was in some ways almost more fun than the primary romance of London and Bennett--but only almost, because I had great fun with them too. I very much liked that London had refreshingly little angst about Bennett's womanizing ways, which led beautifully into Bennett flooring himself with his obligatory Realization of True Love(TM). The big revelation of said True Love in particular was quite charming; look for the ""monkeys in hats"" lines, here.I also have to give Archer props for actually making me not skim past a sex scene, for once. If an author is going to actually make me read a sex scene, she needs to have either a masterful command of the language and make me swoon on the sheer power of words alone. Or, she needs to say something interesting about the involved characters, and give me something more to go on than just the physical depiction. Archer does the latter in a goddess-play scene that I'll freely admit was, indeed, rather hot for the delightful things it said about London as a character and as a woman.Meanwhile, in the main plot, we've got ourselves a chase through Greece through lovingly described islands and waters. The Heirs are still fairly flat as villains--I still never really get a sense of any of the Heirs as actual people rather than bad guys spouting ""For the Glory of Britain!""

In the Introduction, the author writes: ""It is important to keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive Greek language course nor is it a 'Greek phrase book.' Rather, it is intended to be a very quick, very simple introduction to a few of the most basic principles of modern Greek for the student, traveler, or explorer."" This is why I give the book 4 not 5 stars. I was really looking for more of a 'phrase book' and not such a rigorous language course, even if it is a short one. There are ""key phrases"" in each lesson, and they are super useful. But the book was a little too ""serious"" for me.

A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG,1783060581,Viviane Crystal,"[1, 1]","Alesha is the classic &#8220;feral youth,&#8221; and this is her heartbreaking story.  Illiterate, unwanted by her parents, kicked out of every school she attempted to attend, and feeling totally unloved except for her best friend, J.J. who only shows love and care to his elderly grandmother, &#8220;Nan.&#8221;Alesha truly believes she has no options.  There&#8217;s a whole body of language that&#8217;s the Jamaican patois lingo of the gangs in the south end of London and the author supplies a glossary of meaning to those who haven&#8217;t a clue what life is like for these youths.  Most will never survive their young adult years; the others will wind up in jail. Their world is one of &#8220;survival of the fittest, but Alesha wonders in other words what exactly she&#8217;s fit for?This young, 15 year-old girl, earns her money by stealing clothes, delivering dope, cowering in fear to the leaders of gangs who are also at war with each other.  Several times Alesha is the victim of violence, especially when she fails to pay up after one of her drug deliveries goes bad or when she fails to acknowledge that she is owned in reality by those bigger in the criminal hierarchy of the Peckham Crew.  Her closeness to J.J. and earning &#8220;p&#8217;s&#8221; (money) is her whole world and that world is about to undergo a violent transformation.Early on in the story Alesha meets a middle-aged woman and piano teacher, Miss Merfield, who tries to show Alesha she does have options.  Depending on one&#8217;s point of view, one might feel deeply for Alesha&#8217;s attempts to change her life&#8217;s direction or one might perhaps feel quite irritated with her caustic responses in multiple scenes. For her lack of self-respect yields consequences in which she consciously or unconsciously sabotages her own chances for beginning a different lifestyle with reputable employment and education.  Others outside of her gang world certainly haven&#8217;t an ounce of sympathy for gang members like Alesha and a sense of empathy is as close as another planet.  For few of us can even imagine this poignant, tragic lifestyle endured on a daily basis!One doesn&#8217;t enjoy this story but must acknowledge that it&#8217;s a necessary one that needs to be told.  For this astute author deeply believes that the public needs to acquire awareness of just how imprisoned these feral youths are in their own insecurities, fears, and the veneer of toughness.  One realizes how Alesha&#8217;s nasty attitude evolves from rejection to deep-seated anger that breaks out after any innocent or flagrant trigger appears.  One senses how sharing her story turns into a gross betrayal beyond words toward the end of the novel and another event will practically shatter her forever. No, it&#8217;s not far-fetched; it&#8217;s so very real, shocking!This novel was based on the actual 2011 Blackberry London riots.  Polly Courtney, kudos to you for taking on such a huge task of delineating the world of the disenfranchised, of those with no hope and no future.  Whether they succeed or fail, the Miss Merfields of this world deserve even more acclaim for attempting to bring hope to youth who have no basis of believing in anything beyond their criminal and hard-hearted environment!  Words are inadequate to convey the impact of this story that deserves world-wide attention &#8211; for it isn&#8217;t only England&#8217;s problem &#8211; it&#8217;s ours, wherever we live!

A3205Z96VCJAEO,0373210965,Waiting For Wentworth,"[1, 1]","From beginning to end, Heartbeat was such an emotional and heartbreaking story. Emma is dealing with a very difficult situation: her pregnant mother has been declared brain dead after an aneurysm, and her step-father, Dan, has made the decision to keep her body alive and on machines in order to save the baby.Emma visits her mother in the hospital every day, and every day it gets harder and harder for her to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself. She is trying to mourn her mother's death, but it is impossible when she sees her mother's body every day. She feels that her mother and the baby should be allowed to die, and she is angry at Dan for making such a huge decision without asking her opinion first. Emma is hurt and filled with pain and anger, which causes her to lash out at Dan repeatedly. She is often unreasonable, and blames her step-father for everything. It was SO easy to feel sympathy for Emma, but she isn't a likable character. I don't think she's meant to be likable, and that's okay. I was still able to care about her and her situation.Emma feels that her life is completely out of control until she lays eyes on Caleb at the hospital. She recognizes something in him, and they make a connection that they both desperately need. Emma can be herself around Caleb, and doesn't have to hide how much she is hurting. They spend time together and share their grief, knowing that they can't heal the other, but they can at least offer support and understanding.Caleb wasn't at all what I expected, and I found myself really liking him. He has a tragic past, heavy family issues, and terrible, awful parents. I liked that he and Emma were able to make such an unlikely connection. I thought their relationship was beautiful and complex, and they were really able to help each other.Emma's best friend, Olivia, was awesome and so understanding. She is Emma's link to life 'before', and she tried so hard to be there for Emma and support her no matter what. Emma was really lucky to have such a great friend in her life who cared about her so much.Even though Dan was made out to be the bad guy, I tended to side with him because I could relate to him more. I could totally understand his reasons for wanting to save the baby - he knows his wife is dead and the baby will be like having a piece of his wife still with him everyday. If there is the chance that the baby can survive, he is willing to do anything to make it happen.This subject is such a current controversial issue. I can understand the arguments for and against, and whether it is ethical to keep a pregnant woman alive to be an 'incubator'. I do believe the woman's wishes should be taken into account, along with the viability of the fetus. I thought all of these things were handled very well in Heartbeat.

A1X1ZS55QVPU1T,0306811839,Reel To Real,"[1, 1]","This is a disturbing biography for many reasons. I give it four stars because anyone who is fascinated by and wants to learn more about Serge Gainsbourg, as well as Jane Birkin, should read it. Why is it disturbing? First of all, the author, who prides herself on translating the titles of his songs, tells the reader (page 56) that the line in his most famous song 'Je t'aime, moi non plus' (in French only the first word of a song title is capitalized): ""je vais et je viens entre tes reins"" translates to English as ""I come and go between your kidneys."" What? The correct translation, which everyone knows (why didn't she?), is 'between your loins.' Okay, I'm carping about something irrelevant to the substance of the book. However, when it comes to substance, there is barely enough to convey a broad sense of the man and his life. Content is sketchy and woefully thin. What is disturbing is learning how unlikeable a character Gainsbourg actually was. He is the ultimate teflon upstart who charms everyone, gets what he wants, and gets away with everything. You might say 'what's wrong with that?' What's wrong is that he comes across as being too clever by half. I wanted to like him. The more I learned about him however, the less sympathetic I became. The author's juiciest source of information about Gainsbourg comes from her interviews with Jane Birkin. Gainsbourg was attracted to adolescent-like girls. When he met Birkin she was a prolonged adolescent young woman, the perfect type for him. Through her we catch glimpses of Serge at his control-freak worst. Since she is his chief apologist and ever-faithful fan, the real worst is yet to be revealed. What is REALLY disturbing, is what Birkin reveals about what she put up with in their relationship and how she defends Gainsbourg's immorality when it comes to his treatment of their daughter Charlotte. Birkin has some good insights about him, but when she says he was ""never cruel or violent"" she comes across as deluded. I was amused by her telling of the time she threw herself in the Seine to show how upset she was with herself (not with him) for embarrassing him in a nightclub bar. She didn't miss her opportunity to jump in the river, as unhappy French women in Paris occasionally do to express their despair. In the end it is clear that Gainsbourg and Birkin deserved each other. For him, she was the only one who could retain such tender feelings and tolerate his behavior for so long, to his everlasting benefit. What it says about Jane however, is sad.",4.0,DISTURBING,1392940800.0,"02 21, 2014"

Currently I am doing a case study on power and this book has accompanied that aspect well. While I don't agree with America asserting itself as a global power militarily, or even to some extent politically, I still find Zbigniew's assertions quite interesting, concise and correct. He delves into essentially a few subjects (summarized on page 185 in a report card): the Atlantic Alliance, Post-Soviet Space, Far East, Middle East, Proliferation, Peacekeeping, Environment and Global Trade/Poverty, with an emphasis on the first 5 subjects.His analysis of the roles in which these three presidents have played is, in my belief correct on all counts. Bush I was in the B range, Clinton in the C range and Bush II recieved an F. He was most critical of Bush II and most supportive of Bush I, while mixing both sentiments with Clinton. In my belief his support and criticism of all 3 has been rightful. He has asserted that America has fielded badly in its foreign policy and has gradually diminished its global status and influence while only strengthening its military in a world where almost daily we see how hard power and militaristic power is critically limited, while at the same time it diminishes soft power which inturn further limits and weakens hard power again.Many may inteperet Brzeinski's final chapter (Beyon 2008) differently, however in my eyes the following must be done in terms of foreign policy and the international community: America must retract and contract itself militarily while asserting an atlantic alliance more so on a political and economic basis as an equal partner rather than on military and defence basis as an elite protector. It must downsize its military bases and military spending, improve its domestic situation (especially eduaction and information) in order to create a politically active and inforemd society, reduce its political and economic support for Israel and become a moderator rather than remain partial. Hopefully in doing so America will reduce its impreial image to a growing developing world with anti-American sentiment and increase its soft power and improve mutual relationships, wether bilateral, trilateral or multilateral.This is a great read although at times his writing style was antognizing to read.

Casi McLean starts her book with her memories as a happy and loving child, and then moves through her life building the suspense.  What is the secret that her mother never shared?  Why does it have such an affect on her life and her relationships?  I particularly liked her description of high school in the late 60's.  It evoked the era so poignantly and realistically.  I also loved the way she intertwines her actual journal with the book, quoting excerpts as she goes along.  The painful honesty and soul searching are so touching that I felt overwhelmed by her pain.  Then the ending was inspirational and joyful.

When the time comes to remove the staples, the effect of these bends must be neutralized. This device accomplishes that task by inducing a 180 degree bend in the middle of the staple (the portion that is above the skin). One slides the &#34;tongue&#34; of the remover under the staple, centers it carefully and then squeezes the crimper causing the aforementioned 180 degree bend AND, at the same time, pulling the now-vertical staple ends up and out of the skin. It is painless and trivially easy. The only way to goof it up is to fail to center the tongue. Do not make that error or you may render the staple trapped in which case you'll need a chainsaw to remove it. Otherwise the whole procedure should cause no more than a gallon of blood loss tops.Seriously, these ARE easy to use, but if you at all squeamish or nervous about the process, have your surgeon or some other trained medical person remove your staples.",5.0,EASY AS PIE...

Or if you're compulsive like me, an afternoon and evening of good fun. I liked it, yes I did. I liked it because Bylina threaded a contemporary issue through a murder mystery. The issue? Why cannot a Catholic priest serve God while married? Bylina doesn't get real deep into the philosophy, but he does remind us it doesn't derive from Biblical mandates.Back to the mystery: money and lust. That's the engine. That always makes for good fun. Also a genuinely likable hero, which we have in Bylina's detective, who attempts to solve the crime while dealing with a teething baby. And the second protagonist, a nice young church musical director, fits perfectly into the narrative.Bylina brings in other elements that add to the realism -- racism, for one. I like the way he handled that insidious poison. And he didn't make it cliche -- the setting is Pennsylvania, and the young heroine is half-Mexican.What he also does well is weave in backstory to flesh out the narrative. That's always good, right? Makes a reader wan t to cheer.Be prepared for some super good plot twists. When he pulled the first one, I thought &#34;Wow! I did not see that coming.&#34;There's a lot to like about this mystery, and -- well, I understood the conclusion, but darn, I'm not sure it fit with my idea of the way things should turn out.

Catching Jordan was so good, I reread  it twice. Omg. And I hate rereading books, because I'm already going to know what's going to happen. But I guess not with Catching Jordan. ;DThe Cover:It's cute. The bike thing while holding hands. This is random but my brother rode on a  horse while holding hands with his wife for an engagement picture. This cover is kind of like that, but a younger version for teens.The Character:I really love how Miranda Kenneally's characters from the last two books appear in this book. We get to see more of the Jordan-Sam relationship and Parker-Will relationship, which I totally crave and ship. The third book introduces a new couple, Kate and Matt.Matt - Matt went to Cumberland Camp before when he was younger. Back then, he was quiet, shy, geeky. People teased him, bullied him, etc. He almost went suicidal. Until, he met Kate. Kate, who changed how he viewed himself and who kept him alive. Now, he's confident. He's funny, popular, hot. he had a girlfriend named Sarah. They had a three year relationship but they broke up. And Matt was so not expecting to fall in love. Again. With the girl he fell in love with so long ago.Okay, so Matt. Yep. The love story you would imagine. You meet him at camp. You fall in love. You date. Happily ever after. But Kate just couldn't do that.Kate - Kate is really religious. I have nothing against religious people, but she is so religious that I just want to kill her sometimes. And annoying. Like ohmyfreakingawd, what's wrong with you? Apparently, talking to a guy alone is sinning. And I'm like omfg girl, man up. And of course, kissing, making out is way out of hand. I get the no sex thing, but like no holding hands or talking? No wonder you don't have friends.What I like though, is that in a way, characters all connect to each other. Like despite Kate being way down low in the popularity chart, she was still able to go to one of Jordan's popular parties. ;DParker - Parker was already introduced in Stealing Parker. As of she's the main character. Either way, she kind of played a role in this book. She encouraged Kate and Matt's relationship and Parker and Kate actually ended up becoming friend which is good. There are a lot of relationships in this book, but it's cute and all.The Extras:If you haven't gotten the connection yet, Kate goes to Hundred Oaks High School.

On one level, it's incredibly sad to see the story of young lives ripped away when many would say it's too soon and it was a waste. On another, it uplifting to see the incredible faith and strength that these families displayed through the difficulties of missionary work and the devastation of losing the men in their lives. I think it would be hard to read this book as an unbeliever and take much from it beyond that it was a senseless tragedy. Looking at it from my perspective though, I find it challenging and something that everyone who calls themselves a Christian should read at least once in their life to experience what these families went through.There's just not much to say about this book really.

As I said, this app would be a great app for family members to always send nice cards to each other without paying a penny, but, because the designers of the cards made them the way they they are, it can't be used for that purpose.

A1NLVZ294AUJ4P,6305191867,Moviefanatic12,"[6, 6]","After 20 years, Henry remains one of the most compelling horror films ever made. The basic premise - a slice of life approach to the daily activities of a serial killer - had been done before (Bill Lustig's nauseating ""Maniac"") as well as since (the overrated ""Man Bites Dog""), but none approached the impact or verisimilitude of John McNaughton's chiller.Michael Rooker's intense offering is probably the only rendition of a serial killer that gives me nightmares. He seethes with rage and internal brokenness, and with the character of Otis, Tom Towles creates an inimitable caricature of a grotesque clown. Observing his progression from tortured accomplice to drooling necrophiliac is both disturbing and, occasionally, hilarious. In the audio commentary, McNaughton points out the humor that can be appreciated if you can tolerate the stench long enough to locate it. In the most reductive sense, Henry and Otis can be viewed as homicidal buffoons. Their reparte - particularly a post murder bit in a fast food parking lot, and Otis' ""slow on the uptake"" response when Henry hands him a gun in order to kill somebody - can be viewed as nihilistic Abbott and Costello bits.The film's shortcomings mostly enhance its impact. The lack of funds necessitated a harsh, occasionally underlit 16mm look that makes the goings-on all the more realistic. This film is a masterpiece of aesthetic minimalism. Few directors have made equally powerful films under the umbrella of slick hollywood productions.The DVD presentation is first rate. The transfer is clear, and the supplements - particularly a cache of deleted scenes, and a thorough doc present on a second disc - include pretty much everything a ""Henry"" fan could ask for.",5.0,THIS is horror!,1258070400.0,"11 13, 2009"

It smelled really wonderful but the scent was too strong to keep in a frequently used area, so I moved it a little further away from where people normally sit and then the smell was really nice.But in just a couple of days I could no longer smell the scent from that distance so I decided to move it into a small 1/2 bathroom. It did its job nicely for two more days and then there was no longer any noticeable scent. There was still plenty of liquid in the reservoir, so I picked it up and shook the unit gently. After a gentle shake I could sniff it closeup and the pleasant scent was still there. But it no longer produced a noticeable scent that would even slightly permeate in the small bathroom, its scent was only available if I physically put the unit near my nose.

On 10/10/2012 the second unit stopped displaying a picture but still played audio.  On 10/11/2012 I tried to return it to the store for my replacement and Target store informed me the warranty was handled through the phone, so I called Target and they stated the Philips warranty of one year needed to be completed before the Target replacement warranty could be used.  On 10/20/2012 I called Philips for their help in this matter.  they stated the unit was indeed out of warranty and if I truly did buy it on 1/14/2012 I would need to provide a valid proof of purchase and would need to provide them with a CC# in for a 25$ security fee in order for a replacement to be shipped out. On 10/20/2012 I emailed them a scan of the receipt.  I emailed them the next day to confirm they received it, no response.  I called them and they said they were working on it.  On 11/2/2012 I received a cable and I called Philips once again and asked what was going on.  I again informed them I already tried a replacement cable and it did not work (I stated this on 10/20 as well).  Philips told me it was a ""special"" cable and you could not buy it in stores, well, I Ohmed it out and it was a standard video to video cable.  At this phone call on 11/2/2012 I gave Philips my CC# and said I needed a replacement ASAP, they stated it would take 5-10 days to arrive then said the RMA return deposit had increased to 50$--odd.  On 11/12/2012 I called and the person stated their policy changed and it would now take 10-15 days to receive--odd.  On 11/17/2012 I called Philips again questioning the arrival of said replacement unit and they said I should receive it any day.  On 11/22/2012 I called again and they said it was on its way and I should receive it any day.  Finally this last Saturday, 12/1/2012 I was told they were having technical difficulties and they could not tell me whether it had shipped, where it was, if it did ship, and they could not track it at all.

The best Nerf guns are more fun and less expensive.On the plus side, it's very easy to use, and loading the ammo is a snap. We haven't had many misfires or jams. The plastic is decent -- it's not especially heavy duty, but it ain't exactly dollar-store quality, either. The little zombie target is pretty neat, and works as advertised. Hits result in red splotches that fade away after a few minutes. It's light enough to put up with a small tack but heavy enough that it won't tear.On the minus side, we're a little disappointed with the power and accuracy. The effective range only seems to be around 25-30 feet. (Bearing in mind that the ammo is barely large enough to be visible at that distance in bright sunlight, so even if the gun did fire farther, it would be nearly impossible to adjust your aim at longer range.) I suspect that lithium batteries would bump up the power, but those get expensive quickly. As for the accuracy, it's alright for target shooting, but don't expect to hit a moving person at farther than about 15 feet.The ""scope,"" literally just a plastic tube that mounts to the top of the barrel, is for looks only. It's essentially the same as peering through a paper towel roll. You can leave it off if you like.On one hand, the dry ammo is conveniently small when stored. On the other, you have to soak it for 90 minutes before using it, and once you soak it, you have to keep it sealed if you don't fire it right away, and might have to re-soak it. According to the manufacturer, the ammo material is biodegradable and was originally developed for the purpose of hydrating crops. You don't want to eat it, but it shouldn't harm your lawn or foliage.The verdict?

It's easy to figure out how to do basic things like printing, copying, etc., without needing a manual. My problems have been when I've tried to duplex print or scan multiple pages into a pdf rather than a jpg. If I throw the docs in and either through the machine or my computer select 'scan' it automatically scans them into individual pages in jpg format without an easy option or selection for type of file I want. I couldn't quickly and easily figure out how to duplex print either. The manual refers most things to the cd-rom which lacks instructions for both of these issues.

While they are pretty quick to respond, the instructions are long, as in 12-15 steps, and sometimes a bit unclear, often leaving out key things ie: after duplex printing, you actually have to go back in to the software and deselect that feature. Otherwise the printer later jams or thinks it has jammed because it's still trying to print in duplex mode. I haven't been able to get a receipt of confirmation after I've faxed, only if the doc didn't go through. The manual covers the journal, but not the receipts.I never had these issues with any of my HPs. They are just touch and go. When scanning, I'd throw the doc or picture on, hit go and the software would automatically pop up and ask how I wanted it saved, where, and if I had any special requests. Easy-Schmeasy. I never needed the manual for anything, let alone having to refer to a cd-rom, a website and emailing tech support. Faxing and everything else was the same way. My only complaint was that the flatbed read a smaller area than the average size copier, so when I would make reduced copies even, it didn't read outside of the standard 8.5x11 size even though it was larger.I'm pretty computer savvy and if I'm having challenges with this, then it would be especially so for someone who isn't.",3.0,Decent Machine But Not Just Touch & Go,1285286400.0,"09 24, 2010"

Hopping and bopping through the mushroom kingdom, collecting coins, and so-on. Needless to say, when I saw this film I was apalled. How it ever made it onto DVD, I will never know. If the screensaver quality prologue at the start of the film isn't enough to scare you away from the movie, you'll soon notice that the film has very little in common with Sherigu Miyamoto's video game classic that it is named after. There are too many continuity issues to list in this short review, so I won't bother. But basically to sum up the film, if you drained Water World, filled it with weird half lizard-half human creatures and put two badly dressed italian americans in the middle of it you'd have Mario Brothers. If you are a die hard Mario fan, this film will deeply offend you. I wouldn't say it should be completely avoided, as it does offer a few un-intentional giggles, but the film itself it [not good].

This book is about a woman named Jocelyn (or Joss) whose parents and sister were killed in a car accident when she was 14. She has moved to Scotland, where her mother was from, to escape the painful memories. Joss has made herself have a tough exterior and not to let emotional things get in her way, which makes her bottle up all of her feelings inside, refusing to talk about her family. Joss moves into a flat with a girl named Ellie, whom she starts to love as a sister. Ellie also has a brother named Braden, and from the moment she meets him, her life will change. He brings out thoughts and feelings in her that she has refused to let surface for years.The author's writing style is excellent and I like that she would have Joss's inner thoughts next to what really came out of her mouth.

I wasn't very happy about that as I had used it only about fifty times.  Roomba offered to replace it with a top of the line scheduling model for a considerably reduced price to compensate for my loss.  However, it would not have a battery, docking station, charger or lighthouse.  I would have to use all the accessories from my old Roomba or buy anything else I needed.Since it was a top of the line model, I elected to get the new one.  I also decided I wanted to get a much better battery than what I had. After considerable research on these batteries from different sellers, I purchased this battery from ShopXtreme and it is an outstanding performance battery.  I believe it is identical to the one sold by iRobot.  In fact, I believe it is better.  It runs for almost two hours before needing recharge.  Before using it, I charged it for 16 hours even though it came with at least a partial charge.The design of their battery makes it impossible to put it in wrong because there is a protrusion which has to match up with the battery compartment and it will only go in one way.  That is important.The key thing to look for is the rating of the mAh, which is the mili-amp hours.  The higher that number, the better the battery is and the longer the run-time will be.  Mine was 3,500 mAh.  The battery sold by Roomba on their website is only 3,000 mAh and costs $89.00.  It doesn't take much to realize that the one at ShopXtreme is a great value.I would also caution you not to buy a NiCad battery which may look very similar to these and will also work in your unit.  It is an easy mistake to make and may be tempting because they cost less and look the same.  However they are the older version batteries much inferior to these and can develop a memory which will result in a short battery life and poor performance.  Make sure it is an Ni-MH.I can't speak for the other vendors, but if you order what I did from ShopXtreme, I am quite sure you will be happy and completely satisfied.",5.0,As good or better than iRobot original... from ShopXtreme,1282780800.0,"08 26, 2010"

Mel didn't spend enough writing time in developing a believable character here, in my humble estimation.Known for his past Gold Eagle novels, both in the Deathlands and Outlanders series, Mel Odom did his best work in the Deathlands series. (But his first foray into the Outlanders series was solid, too. It was his latter written books that were mediocre.)But back to his current work. Rogue Angel starts out in France, and has the reader following archeologist-turned-explorer-turned-TV monster show host-Annja Creed into a web of mystery and suspence. The overall storyline has potential, but the main character, along with the main bad guys, come off way too cookie cutter and one-dimensional and uncolorful.The action sequences are OK, but either come off too comic-bookish or like a computer game, like Tomb Raider. (That's really all I could unfortunately think of while reading this book.)Annja's two new sidekicks here become a timeless duo of an old man and a male model type, both were connected since watching the burning death of their liege, Joan of Arc, centuries before. Unfortunately, they have since become bitter enemies,(but which comes off too comically in the present timeframe.) Overall, the effect of realism just didn't work for me. These two characters could have been fleshed-out more cohesively.Now, I'm not the type of reviewer that tells readers all that happens in any given novel. I hate that. Gives things away, thus ruining anything for the potential reader. Suffice it to say, Mel Odom is a gifted writer at times.

It isn't too long before he - and Agutter, and Doctor John Woodvine - realize he isn't hallucinating.Very well-directed and -acted piece, balancing horror and humor nicely, though not as smoothly and subtly as the contemporaneous The Howling. The balance is carried off by straight-faced and nightmarish surrealism, and the wholesomeness of the genuinely appealing young cast. The clever juxtaposition of American and British culture helps immensely, adding both to the humor and the realism.This is a truly unique piece, not really succeeding either as a comedy or a horror film, yet satisfying somehow on both levels.

A3HEM1WWXXLOUL,B000002WNO,"""douglasnegley""","[8, 8]","I was floored by this CD when I first heard it. First of all, the sound, for a Live show, at Newport in 1967, is good. Second, the band - featuring players like Snooky Young, Joe Newman, Al Grey, Frank Foster, Jerome Richardson, George Duvivier...need I say more - is on high throttle, and obviously enjoying themselves. This Big Band is every bit as 'tight-loose' (if you catch my drift) as Dizzy's in '57, or Terry Gibbs' in '59. In fact, this band reminds me a whole lot of that Gibbs band in the way they swing, and sway, too. Both do great versions of &quot;Flying Home&quot;, also. I think it was the 'sway' that turned a lot of the 'baby-boomers' off to Big Band jazz. Hopefully, it is more appreciated these days, now that Geritol bottles are finding their way into the same generation's cabinents. Seriously, though, it is great, classic American music. This band shows the time period in which the Live recordings were made, also. &quot;Greasy Greens&quot; is a classic 1967-style pop-funk tune. &quot;Tempo's Birthday&quot; is one of my favorites, being both a 'swing' and 'sway' tune, punctuated with classic section 'hits' in the arrangement. Frank Foster's &quot;Misunderstood Blues&quot; is hilarious, as well as bluesy - a kind of 'tip-of-the-hat' to Clark Terry's classic vocal routine of the same variety. &quot;Meet Benny Bailey&quot; is a minor-mode vehicle for Snooky Young to shine on, which he surely does. Then comes the Hampton rhythm-and-blues classic &quot;Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop, with &quot;Hamp's Boogie Woogie&quot; inside of it, and this time, Hamp gets to show his piano chops, the band responding in full throttle. &quot;Flying Home&quot; finds Hamp doing what he does best: killing on the vibes. An encore, apropos of the period, features one more go 'round of &quot;Greasy Greens&quot;, featuring Billy Mackel on the electric guitar solo. The rest of the tracks are studio releases, but this CD ranks with the best Live swinging Big Bands of modern times. It is a hidden treasure.",5.0,Lionel and the All-Star Alumni Band COOKS!

(Wrist rests on the desk, fingertips are the only thing on the mouse, I move the mouse with just my thumb and pinky/3rd finger).- I have small hands (7 inches from my palm to the very tip of my middle finger).- I have used Logitech mice since the MX510 I bought in 2004. I've tried other mice, but they usually just don't work for my kind of  hand and grip. Either they are too large, too tall, or just plain aren't made for people who move the mouse with their fingertips. A great example of this is the Naga 2014. It has a place to rest the user's 3rd finger. It just doesn't work with a fingertip grip because I use that finger to move the mouse.I've really liked other logitech mice like the MX510, G500, and G700.. but I LOVE this mouse. It takes everything that was great about those other mice and makes it easier to use because of a lower profile. The sensor on it feels very accurate and if you want to get into specifics about it, look at some reviews about the new sensor. There is a bunch of stuff I could talk about and bore you to death, but lets just say its an amazing sensor that is very accurate. It will even have you &#34;scan&#34; the surface you use it on to calibrate itself to the surface.Overall this mouse is just amazing for people like me. If you have small hands and use the same kind of grip, I would give this a shot. Even if your current mouse is good enough, go give this one as shot and you won't be disappointed. If you have large hands, use a different grip, or just don't like the shape/profile that Logitech uses with their mice, your mileage may vary.

Turner uses various publicly known intelligence failures as reference points to specific and often very good comments on the structure and processes of intelligence production.

A1QA59ISWKCHHB,0316101621,Lawral Wornek,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that you should not judge this book by its cover. Or by its opening lines:""Frailty, thy name is woman."" - William Shakespeare""Willy, thy name is sexism."" - OpheliaDon't get me wrong, both have very much to do with the story (other than Hamlet's hair color on the cover), but they really make this look like a much lighter, funnier, beach read kind of book than it really is. I mean, really, how would one make an adaption of Hamlet light? Instead, this book is everything it should be; it's brooding and dark and, at times, intense. It's also narrated by a strong Ophelia who is understandably worried (and sometimes so tired/drunk she's a bit loopy - how else could one explain the flower scene?) about her boyfriend's apparent loss of sanity but who also does her best to be supportive and helpful to those around her, especially her aforementioned boyfriend and her widower father, all while trying to keep her own life together in the midst of circumstances no high school senior should have to deal with. She is so at odds with both the classic and modern versions of how we usually see the character of Ophelia. I loved it.The story stays pretty true to the original, with one major difference that is given away on the jacket flap: Ophelia survives. The motivations behind people's actions, however, are different. The ""truth,"" what Ophelia is telling us the readers, is book-ended by Ophelia's tell-all appearance on fake-Danish-Oprah in the beginning of each chapter and her interrogation by the Danish police at the end. These three concurrent tellings of the same story, illustrate the fabrication of what we take for ""fact"" from the media and the reach of a government cover-up more explicitly than that paparazzi pic on the cover ever could. On faux-prah, Ophelia is sweet, in love, heart-broken, and kind of ditzy. She's the almost princess. While being interrogated, she is bitingly sarcastic, angry, and fiercely loyal to Horatio and Marcellus, the only other people to survive the bloodbath that is this story. She's accused of being the master-mind of a plot to overthrow the Danish monarchy. In between, she's just a girl doing her best to do what's right for herself and those she loves.Really and truly, I loved this book. It sucked me into the story and kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew, more or less, what was going to happen. The characters were well-rounded and real in ways that Shakespeare characters usually are not. I cried when the king died. Have you ever cared about Hamlet's dad enough to even care that he's dead? I haven't. And Hamlet himself made a bit more sense, not a lot, but a bit. Giving him a happy background with Ophelia, at least in flashbacks, made their whole relationship much more believable which made it all the more crushing when he becomes cruel. Michelle Ray has managed to take a story that I already knew well and liked, and she made it into something new and original that I love.

Then 3 weeks ago, the kids dropped their IPad 1 and absolutely destroyed it, because someone forgot to put on the Otterbox Auntie sent them. There is a moral to this story &#60;g&#62;. ;-)So, since the children's life and education was on their ipad, a replacement needed to be found. Luckily, Auntie just upgraded to the IPad Air and had my old IPad 1 just sitting in its box. So, I made a big care package and just sent it to them (it was tough as it looked brand new and I knew what it would look like in just 3 days &#60;vbg&#62; ;-)However, this time it was in an Otterbox which I was very tempted to superglue closed &#60;eg&#62;! Looking at that bulky, heavy and ugly Otterbox, I wished I could have replaced it with something much lighter, and cooler from Fintie, but could nit find anything. However, I did find Fintie's Galaxy cases, that I am discussing here, and included them in the gift box.When I decided I also wanted to protect their Galazys, but without spending lots of money, I turned to Fintie. I think they make some of the best cases, for the lowest prices! I bought each or the shield series for under $5 each! Go figure, as they told me the otterbox they looked at was about $100? Anyway, the point is, the Fintie cases I bought made the Otterbox look heavy, bulky and not nearly as nice looking. Even if it would protect my phone from a nuclear explosion, there is no way I would out that thing on my phone!I received a call from my very grateful relatives a week later. They loved the Ipad (of course, it was free &#60;g&#62;)! They said that the Galaxy note shield fit liked a glove, they loved it, and agreed it was a great alternative to the expensive otterbox.Just so you know, the Fintie cover is really constructed well, and will protect from much dust, dirt and water drops.It also has great coverage of all ports and it's jacket fits just perfectly. Although their is no front cover, I just sent them the top of the line screen savers. This saves a lot of weight and I still think their phones will be very safe. Besides, I just got their kids a new used IPad so mommy and daddy should keep their phone hidden from the kids &#60;g&#62;. Auntie has no more extra phones and pads if these break &#60;g&#62;. ;-)Bottom line is, if you have young children, get a heavy duty case. :)You don't need to spend a fortune because Fintie makes a great alternative at a wicked low price.
